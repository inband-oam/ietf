      <t>In-situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM) is used
      for recording and collecting operational and telemetry information. 
	  Specifically, IOAM allows telemetry data to be pushed into data packets
	  while they traverse the network. This document introduces a new IOAM 
	  option type called the Direct Export (DEX) option, which is used as 
	  a trigger for IOAM data to be directly exported to a collector without 
	  being pushed into in-flight data packets.</t>

		  <t>The DEX option is used as a trigger to export IOAM data from the network. The trigger applies to transit nodes, the decapsulating

		  <t>As in <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data"/>, the DEX option

		  the export format can be based on 
		  <xref target="I-D.spiegel-ippm-ioam-rawexport"/>.</t>
		  
		  <t>A transit IOAM node that does not support the DEX option SHOULD

	  <t>Therefore, rate limiting may be enabled so as to ensure that 
	  direct exporting is used at a rate that does not significantly affect 
	  the network bandwidth, and does not overload the collector (or the 
	  source node in the case of loopback). It should be possible to use 
	  each DEX on a subset of the data traffic, and load balance across multiple collectors.</t>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The security considerations of IOAM in general are discussed in 
	  <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data"/>. Specifically, an attacker
	  may try to use the functionality that is defined in this document 
	  to attack the network.</t>
	  
	  <t>An attacker may attempt to overload network devices by injecting 
	  synthetic packets that include the DEX option. Similarly, an on-path 
	  attacker may maliciously incorporate the DEX option into transit 
	  packets, or remove it from packets that the option is already incorporated into.</t>
	  
	  <t>Forcing DEX, either in synthetic packets or in transit packets may 
	  overload the network, the collector or the analyzer devices. Since this mechanism affects 
	  multiple devices along the network path, it potentially amplifies the 
	  effect on the network bandwidth and on the collector's load.</t>
	  
	  
	  <t>In order to mitigate the attacks described above, it should be 
	  possible for IOAM-enabled devices to limit the exported IOAM data
	  to a configurable rate.</t>
	  
	  <t>IOAM is assumed to be deployed in a restricted administrative domain,
	  thus limiting the scope of the threats above and their affect. This is
	  a fundamental assumption with respect to the security aspects of IOAM, as
	  further discussed in <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data"/>.</t>

		  <t>Hop Limit / Hop Count: in order to help correlate and order the 
		  exported packets, it is possible to include a 1-octet 
		  Hop Count field in the DEX header (presumably by claiming some space 
		  from the Flags field). Its value starts from 0 at the encapsulating 
		  node and is incremented by each IOAM transit node that supports
		  the DEX option, which contradict the idea that intermediate devides shouldn't edit the DEX header. The Hop Count field value is also included in the 
		  exported packet. An alternative approach is to use the 
		  Hop_Lim/Node_ID data field; if the IOAM-Trace-Type 
		  <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data"/> has the Hop_Lim/Node_ID bit 
		  set, then exported packets include the Hop_Lim/Node_ID data field, 
		  which contains the TTL/Hop Limit value from a lower layer protocol.
		  The main advantage of the Hop_Lim/Node_ID approach is that it 
		  provides information about the current hop count without requiring 
		  each transit node to modify the DEX option, thus simplifying the data 
		  plane functionality of Direct Exporting.
		  The main advantage of the Hop Count approach is that it counts the 
		  number of IOAM-capable nodes without relying on the lower layer TTL, 
		  especially when the lower layer cannot prvide the accurate TTL
		  information, e.g., Layer 2 Ethernet or hierarchical VPN. It also 
		  explicitly allows to detect a case where an IOAM-capable node fails 
		  to export packets to the collector. In order to facilitate the Hop 
		  Count approach it is possible to use a flag to indicate an optional Hop Count 
		  field, which enables to control the tradeoff. On one hand it addresses the 
		  use cases that the Hop_Lim/Node_ID cannot cover, and on the other hand
		  it does not require transit switches to update the option if it is not 
		  supported or disabled. But, in this case these nodes will be invisible, which may cause misunderstanding of the network compared to the TTL approach.
		  Further discussion is required about the tradeoff between the 
		  three alternatives.</t>
