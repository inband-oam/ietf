1.  Introduction

   "In-situ" Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM) records
   OAM information within the packet while the packet traverses a
   particular network domain.  The term "in-situ" refers to the fact
   that the OAM data is added to the data packets rather than being sent
   within packets specifically dedicated to OAM.  IOAM is to complement
   mechanisms such as Ping or Traceroute.  In terms of "active" or



Brockners, et al.         Expires 18 April 2024                 [Page 2]

Internet-Draft         IOAM-Data-Fields Integrity           October 2023


   "passive" OAM, "in-situ" OAM can be considered a hybrid OAM type.
   "In-situ" mechanisms do not require extra packets to be sent.  IOAM
   adds information to the already available data packets and therefore
   cannot be considered passive.  In terms of the classification given
   in [RFC7799], IOAM could be portrayed as Hybrid Type I.  IOAM
   mechanisms can be leveraged where mechanisms using, e.g., ICMP do not
   apply or do not offer the desired results, such as proving that a
   certain traffic flow takes a pre-defined path, SLA verification for
   the data traffic, detailed statistics on traffic distribution paths
   in networks that distribute traffic across multiple paths, or
   scenarios in which probe traffic is potentially handled differently
   from regular data traffic by the network devices.

   IOAM MUST be deployed in an IOAM-Domain.  An IOAM-Domain is a set of
   nodes that use IOAM.  An IOAM-Domain is bounded by its perimeter or
   edge.  It is expected that all nodes in an IOAM-Domain are managed by
   the same administrative entity, that has means to select, monitor,
   and control the access to all the networking devices.  As such, IOAM-
   Data-Fields are carried in clear within packets and there are no
   protections against any node or middlebox tampering with the data.
   IOAM-Data-Fields collected in an untrusted or semi-trusted
   environment require integrity protection to support critical
   operational decisions.  Please refer to [RFC9197] for more details on
   IOAM-Domains.

   The following considerations and requirements are to be taken into
   account in addition to addressing the problem of detectability of any
   integrity breach of the IOAM-Data-Fields collected:

   1.  IOAM data is processed by the data plane, hence viability of any
       method to prove integrity of the IOAM-Data-Fields must be
       feasible at data plane processing/forwarding rates (IOAM might be
       applied to all traffic a router forwards).

   2.  IOAM data is carried within packets.  Additional space required
       to prove integrity of the IOAM-Data-Fields needs to be optimal,
       i.e.  should not exceed the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) or
       have adverse effect on packet processing.

   3.  Protection against replay of old IOAM data should be possible.
       Without replay protection, a rogue node can present the old IOAM
       data, masking any ongoing network issues/activity and making the
       IOAM-Data-Fields collection useless.

   This document defines a method to protect the integrity of IOAM-Data-
   Fields, using the IOAM Option-Types specified in [RFC9197] and
   [RFC9326] as an example.  The method will similarly apply to future
   IOAM Option-Types.

3.  Threat Analysis

   This section presents a threat analysis of integrity-related threats
   in the context of IOAM.  The threats that are discussed are assumed
   to be independent of the lower layer protocols; it is assumed that
   threats at other layers are handled by security mechanisms that are
   deployed at these layers.

   This document is focused on integrity protection for IOAM-Data-
   Fields.  Thus the threat analysis includes threats that are related
   to or result from compromising the integrity of IOAM-Data-Fields.
   Other security aspects such as confidentiality are not within the
   scope of this document.

   Throughout the analysis there is a distinction between on-path and
   off-path attackers.  As discussed in [RFC9055], on-path attackers are
   located in a position that allows interception and modification of
   in-flight protocol packets, whereas off-path attackers can only
   attack by generating protocol packets.

   The analysis also includes the impact of each of the threats.
   Generally speaking, the impact of a successful attack on an OAM
   protocol [RFC7276] is a false illusion of nonexistent failures or
   preventing the detection of actual ones; in both cases, the attack



Brockners, et al.         Expires 18 April 2024                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft         IOAM-Data-Fields Integrity           October 2023


   may result in denial of service (DoS).  Furthermore, creating the
   false illusion of a nonexistent issue may trigger unnecessary
   processing in some of the IOAM nodes along the path, and may cause
   more IOAM-related data to be exported to the management plane than is
   conventionally necessary.  Beyond these general impacts, threat-
   specific impacts are discussed in each of the subsections below.

3.1.  Modification: IOAM-Data-Fields

   Threat

      An on-path attacker can modify the IOAM-Data-Fields of in-transit
      packets.  The modification can either be applied to all packets or
      selectively applied to a subset of the en route packets.
      Maliciously modified IOAM-Data-Fields can for example mislead
      network diagnostics, result in incorrect network performance
      metrics, or could misguide network optimization efforts.

   Impact

      By systematically modifying the IOAM-Data-Fields of some or all of
      the in-transit packets, an attacker can create a false picture of
      the paths in the network, the existence of faulty nodes and their
      location, and the network performance.

3.2.  Modification: IOAM Option-Type Headers

   Threat

      An on-path attacker can modify the header in IOAM Option-Types in
      order to change or disrupt the behavior of nodes processing IOAM-
      Data-Fields along the path.

   Impact

      Changing the header of IOAM Option-Types may have several
      implications.  An attacker can maliciously increase the processing
      overhead in nodes that process IOAM-Data-Fields and increase the
      on-the-wire overhead of IOAM-Data-Fields, for example by modifying
      the IOAM-Trace-Type field in the IOAM Trace Option-Type header.
      An attacker can also prevent some of the nodes that process IOAM-
      Data-Fields from incorporating IOAM-Data-Fields, by modifying the
      RemainingLen field in the IOAM Trace Option-Type header.  Another
      possibility for the attacker is to change the context of IOAM-
      Data-Fields by modifying the Namespace-ID field in IOAM Option-
      Type headers, which makes the integrity protection of IOAM-Data-
      Fields completely useless.

Internet-Draft         IOAM-Data-Fields Integrity           October 2023


3.3.  Injection: IOAM-Data-Fields

   Threat

      An attacker can inject packets with IOAM Option-Types and IOAM-
      Data-Fields.  This threat is applicable to both on-path and off-
      path attackers.

   Impact

      This attack and its impacts are similar to Section 3.1.

3.4.  Injection: IOAM Option-Type Headers

   Threat

      An attacker can inject packets with IOAM Option-Type headers, thus
      manipulating other nodes that process IOAM-Data-Fields in the
      network.  This threat is applicable to both on-path and off-path
      attackers.

   Impact

      This attack and its impacts are similar to Section 3.2.

3.5.  Replay

   Threat

      An attacker can replay packets with IOAM-Data-Fields.
      Specifically, an attacker may replay a previously transmitted IOAM
      Option-Type with a new data packet, therefore attaching old IOAM-
      Data-Fields to a fresh user packet.  This threat is applicable to
      both on-path and off-path attackers.

   Impact

      By replaying old IOAM-Data-Fields, an attacker can create a false
      picture of the network status.  The attacker could simulate a
      nonexistent failure, or incur non-required processing load on
      nodes that process these IOAM-Data-Fields.

3.6.  Management and Exporting

   Threat

Internet-Draft         IOAM-Data-Fields Integrity           October 2023


      Attacks that compromise the integrity of IOAM-Data-Fields can be
      applied at the management plane, e.g., by manipulating network
      management packets.  Furthermore, the integrity of IOAM-Data-
      Fields that are exported to a receiving entity can also be
      compromised.  Management plane attacks are not within the scope of
      this document; the network management protocol is expected to
      include inherent security capabilities.  The integrity of exported
      data is also not within the scope of this document.  It is
      expected that the specification of the export format will discuss
      the relevant security aspects.

   Impact

      Malicious manipulation of the management protocol can cause nodes
      that process IOAM-Data-Fields to malfunction, to be overloaded, or
      to incorporate unnecessary IOAM-Data-Fields into user packets.
      The impact of compromising the integrity of exported IOAM-Data-
      Fields is similar to the impacts of previous threats that were
      described in this section.

3.7.  Delay

   Threat

      An on-path attacker may delay some or all of the in-transit
      packets that include IOAM-Data-Fields in order to create the false
      illusion of congestion.  Delay attacks are well known in the
      context of deterministic networks [RFC9055] and synchronization
      [RFC7384], and may be somewhat mitigated in these environments by
      using redundant paths in a way that is resilient to an attack
      along one of the paths.  This approach does not address the threat
      in the context of IOAM, as it does not meet the requirement to
      measure a specific path or to detect a problem along the path.  It
      is noted that this threat is not within the scope of the threats
      that are mitigated in this document.

   Impact

      Since IOAM can be applied to a fraction of the traffic, an
      attacker can detect and delay only the packets that include IOAM-
      Data-Fields, thus preventing the authenticity of delay and load
      measurements.

4.4.1.  Header fields for integrity protection

   The following IOAM DEX Option-Type header fields are involved in the
   integrity protection of IOAM-Data-Fields:

   1.  Namespace-ID

   2.  Extension-Flags: only bits 0 (Flow ID) and 1 (Sequence Number)

   3.  IOAM-Trace-Type

Internet-Draft         IOAM-Data-Fields Integrity           October 2023


   The optional fields (i.e., Flow ID and Sequence Number) are treated
   as optional IOAM-Data-Fields, not header fields.

5.  Integrity Protection Method

   This section defines a method that uses a symmetric key based
   signature algorithm for integrity protection of IOAM-Data-Fields.  In
   case of performance concerns, the method can be applied to a subset
   of the traffic by using sampling of data.

   The symmetric key based signature algorithm MUST use SHA-256 ([SHS])
   as the Digest Algorithm, and MUST use Advanced Encryption Standard
   ([AES]) with a key length of 256 bits and the Galois/Counter Mode
   ([NIST.800-38D]) as the Signature Algorithm (AES-256-GCM).  The
   corresponding Signature Suite Identifier is 1, as defined in
   Section 6.2.  As a consequence, the signature consumes 32 octets.
   The Integrity Protection Method is defined by the following steps:

   1.  The encapsulating node creates a nonce and stores it in the Nonce
       field of the IOAM Integrity Protection Header (the Nonce length
       field is set accordingly).  The Signature-suite field is set to
       1.  The signature is generated over the hash of header fields
       (see Section 4.1.1, Section 4.2.1, Section 4.3.1, or
       Section 4.4.1, for the exact list of header fields to include in
       the signature, depending on the IOAM Integrity Protected Option-
       Type) and IOAM-Data-Fields it has inserted, i.e.,
       sign(hash(Header-Fields || IOAM-Data-Fields)), with the Nonce
       field provided as the nonce.  IOAM-Data-Fields supposed to be
       modified by other IOAM nodes on the path MUST be excluded from
       the signature (e.g., the POT Cumulative field).  The signature is
       stored in the Signature field of the IOAM Integrity Protection
       Header.

   2.  A transit node generates a signature over the hash of IOAM-Data-
       Fields it has inserted, i.e., sign(hash(IOAM-Data-Fields)), with
       the Signature field provided as the nonce.  IOAM-Data-Fields
       modified in-place by the transit node MUST be excluded from the
       signature (e.g., the POT Cumulative field).  The signature is
       stored in the Signature field of the IOAM Integrity Protection
       Header.

       *  If the transit node does not insert IOAM-Data-Fields (e.g., it
          only modifies IOAM-Data-Fields in-place, or does nothing),
          then the transit node MUST NOT generate a signature and MUST
          NOT update the Signature field.

   3.  In the context of the Integrity Protection Method, a node that
       performs the validation of the integrity protection is referred
       to as a "Validator".  The role of a Validator is to recompute the
       signature by iteratively following the previous steps of the
       method, in the same order and up to itself, using the respective
       symmetric keys.  The recomputed signature is then compared to the
       Signature field.  As a result, the Validator can detect if the
       IOAM-Data-Fields integrity is intact or was altered.  The
       validation is trivial in some cases (e.g., with POT Type-0, E2E
       or DEX Option-Types), where only the encapsulating node generates
       a signature, as specified above by this method.  For other cases
       where transit nodes also generate a signature (e.g., with Trace
       Option-Types), node-ids MUST be included in IOAM-Data-Fields.
       Details on how the mapping between node-ids and keys is
       implemented on a Validator are outside the scope of this
       document.

       *  Each node that takes actions triggered by fields in the IOAM
          Integrity Protected Option-Type header MUST act as a
          Validator.  Otherwise, an attacker could modify the IOAM
          header along the path and change the actions a node performs.
          Examples:

          -  For an Integrity Protected Trace Option-Type (Pre-allocated
             or Incremental), each transit node MUST act as a Validator,
             if either the IOAM Loopback or Active mode is used.

          -  For an Integrity Protected DEX Option-Type, each transit
             node MUST act as a Validator.

       *  The decapsulating node MUST act as a Validator.  The
          decapsulating node MUST NOT generate a signature based on
          IOAM-Data-Fields it has inserted, if any, and therefore MUST
          NOT update the Signature field.

   The method assumes that symmetric keys have been distributed to the
   respective nodes as well as the Validator(s).  The details of the
   mechanisms used for key distribution are outside the scope of this
   document.

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  IOAM Option-Types

   IANA is requested to define the following new code points in the
   "IOAM Option-Type" registry:

Internet-Draft         IOAM-Data-Fields Integrity           October 2023


   64
      IOAM Pre-allocated Trace Integrity Protected Option-Type (see
      Section 4)

   65
      IOAM Incremental Trace Integrity Protected Option-Type (see
      Section 4)

   66  IOAM POT Integrity Protected Option-Type (see Section 4)

   67  IOAM E2E Integrity Protected Option-Type (see Section 4)

   68  IOAM DEX Integrity Protected Option-Type (see Section 4)

   A document defining a new IOAM Integrity Protected Option-Type MUST
   define the IOAM Option-Type header fields involved in the integrity
   protection of IOAM-Data-Fields, as done in Section 4.1.1,
   Section 4.2.1, Section 4.3.1, and Section 4.4.1 of this document.

6.2.  IOAM Integrity Protection Signature Suite

   IANA is requested to define a new registry named "IOAM Integrity
   Protection Signature Suite", inside the "In Situ OAM (IOAM)" registry
   group.

   The new registry defines 256 code points to identify the digest and
   signature algorithms used in the Signature-suite field, as explained
   in Section 4.  The following code points are defined in this
   document:

    Signature
    Suite        Digest       Signature     Specification
    Identifier   Algorithm    Algorithm     Pointer

   Code points 2-254 are available for assignment via the "IETF Review"
   process, as per [RFC8126].

   New registration requests MUST use the following template: the value
   of the requested code point, the associated digest algorithm name and
   signature algorithm name, and a reference to the document that
   defines the requested code point.

7.  Security Considerations

   Please refer to Section 3 for a threat analysis of integrity-related
   threats in the context of IOAM.

   The Integrity Protection Method defined in this document (see
   Section 5) leverages symmetric keys.  The symmetric keys need to be
   exchanged in a secure way between the nodes involved with integrity
   protection of IOAM-Data-Fields.  The details of the key exchange are
   outside the scope of this document.

   The Integrity Protection Method defined in this document requires
   additional per-packet processing by each node that uses it.
   Inappropriate use of the Integrity Protection Method might overload
   nodes and cause them to stop functioning properly.  Operators
   deploying IOAM with the Integrity Protection Method MUST ensure that
   such overload situations are avoided.  This could for example be
   achieved by applying IOAM only to a subset of the entire traffic.

   The Nonce makes a signature chain unique but does not necessarily
   prevent replay attacks.  To enable replay protection, the
   encapsulating node and the Validator(s) MUST agree on a common
   methodology to keep the Nonce valid only for a specific period of
   time, which is outside the scope of this document.
