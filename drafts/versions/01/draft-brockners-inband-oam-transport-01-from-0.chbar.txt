 Abstract
 
    In-band operation, administration and maintenance (OAM) records
    operational and telemetry information in the packet while the packet
    traverses a path between two points in the network.  In-band OAM is
    to complement current out-of-band OAM mechanisms based on ICMP or
    other types of probe packets.  This document outlines how in-band OAM
    data records can be transported in protocols such as NSH, Segment
    Routing, VXLAN-GPE, native IPv6 (via extension header), and IPv4.
    Transport options are currently investigated as part of an
    implementation study.  This document is intended to only serve
    informational purposes.

 1.  Introduction
 
    This document discusses transport mechanisms for "in-band" operation,
    administration, and maintenance (OAM) data records.  In-band OAM
    records OAM information within the packet while the packet traverses
    a particular network domain.  The term "in-band" refers to the fact
    that the OAM data is added to the data packets rather than is being
    sent within packets specifically dedicated to OAM.  A discussion of
    the motivation and requirements for in-band OAM can be found in
    [draft-brockners-inband-oam-requirements].  Data types and data
    formats for in-band OAM are defined in
    [draft-brockners-inband-oam-data].
 
    This document outlines transport encapsulations for the in-band OAM
    data defined in [draft-brockners-inband-oam-data].  This document is
    to serve informational purposes only.  As part of an in-band OAM
    implementation study different protocol encapsulations for in-band
    OAM data are being explored.  Once data formats and encapsulation
    approaches are settled, protocol specific specifications for in-band
    OAM data transport will address the standardization aspect.
 
    The data for in-band OAM defined in [draft-brockners-inband-oam-data]
    can be carried in a variety of protocols based on the deployment
    needs.  This document discusses transport of in-band OAM data for the
    following protocols:
 
    o  IPv6
 
    o  VXLAN-GPE
 
    o  NSH
 
    o  Segment Routing (IPv6 and MPLS)
 
    This list is non-exhaustive, as it is possible to carry the in-band
    OAM data in several other protocols and transports.
 
    A feasibility study of in-band OAM is currently underway as part of
    the FD.io project [FD.io].  The in-band OAM implementation study
    should be considered as a "tool box" to showcase how "in-band" OAM
    can complement probe-packet based OAM mechanisms for different
    deployments and packet transport formats.  For details, see the open
    source code in the FD.io [FD.io].

 3.  In-Band OAM Metadata Transport in IPv6
 
    This mechanisms of in-band OAM in IPv6 complement others proposed to
    enhance diagnostics of IPv6 networks, such as the IPv6 Performance
    and Diagnostic Metrics Destination Option described in
    [I-D.ietf-ippm-6man-pdm-option].  The IP Performance and Diagnostic
    Metrics Destination Option is destination focused and specific to
    IPv6, whereas in-band OAM is performed between end-points of the
    network or a network domain where it is enabled and used.
 
    A historical note: The idea of IPv6 route recording was originally
    introduced by [draft-kitamura-ipv6-record-route] back in year 2000.
    With IPv6 now being generally deployed and new concepts such as
    Segment Routing [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing] being introduced,
    it is imperative to further mature the operations, administration,
    and maintenance mechanisms available to IPv6 networks.
 
    The in-band OAM options translate into options for an IPv6 extension
    header.  The extension header would be inserted by either a host
    source of the packet, or by a transit/domain-edge node.
 
 3.1.  In-band OAM in IPv6 Hop by Hop Extension Header
 
    This section defines in-band OAM for IPv6 transport.  In-band OAM
    data is transported as an IPv6 hop-by-hop extension header.
 
 3.1.1.  In-band OAM Hop by Hop Options
 
    Brief recap of the IPv6 hop-by-hop header as well as the options used
    for carrying in-band OAM data:
 
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |  Next Header  |  Hdr Ext Len  |                               |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+                               +
     |                                                               |
     .                                                               .
     .                            Options                            .
     .                                                               .
     |                                                               |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
 
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+- - - - - - - - -
       |  Option Type  |  Opt Data Len |  Option Data
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+- - - - - - - - -
 
    With 2 highest order bits of Option Type indicating the following:
 
       00 - skip over this option and continue processing the header.
 
       01 - discard the packet.
 
       10 - discard the packet and, regardless of whether or not the
            packet's Destination Address was a multicast address, send an
            ICMP Parameter Problem, Code 2, message to the packet's
            Source Address, pointing to the unrecognized Option Type.
 
       11 - discard the packet and, only if the packet's Destination
            Address was not a multicast address, send an ICMP Parameter
            Problem, Code 2, message to the packet's Source Address,
            pointing to the unrecognized Option Type.
 
    3rd highest bit:
 
       0 - Option Data does not change en-route
 
       1 - Option Data may change en-route
 
    In-band OAM data records are inserted as options in an IPv6 hop-by-
    hop extension header:
 
    1.  Tracing Option: The in-band OAM Tracing option defined in
        [draft-brockners-inband-oam-data] is represented as a IPv6 option
        in hop by hop extension header by allocating following type:
 
        Option Type:  001xxxxxx 8-bit identifier of the type of option.
           xxxxxx=TBD_IANA_TRACE_OPTION_IPV6.
 
    2.  Proof of Transit Option: The in-band OAM POT option defined in
        [draft-brockners-inband-oam-data] is represented as a IPv6 option
        in hop by hop extension header by allocating following type:
 
        Option Type:  001xxxxxx 8-bit identifier of the type of option.
           xxxxxx=TBD_IANA_POT_OPTION_IPV6.
 
    3.  Edge to Edge Option: The in-band OAM E2E option defined in
        [draft-brockners-inband-oam-data] is represented as a IPv6 option
        in hop by hop extension header by allocating following type:
 
        Option Type:  000xxxxxx 8-bit identifier of the type of option.
           xxxxxx=TBD_IANA_E2E_OPTION_IPV6.
 
 3.1.2.  Procedure at the Ingress Edge to Insert the In-band OAM Header
 
    In an administrative domain where in-band OAM is used, insertion of
    the in-band OAM header is enabled at the required edge nodes by means
    of configuration.
 
    Such a config SHOULD allow selective enablement of in-band OAM header
    insertion for a subset of traffic (e.g., one or several "pipes").
 
    Further the ingress edge node should be aware of maximum size of the
    header that can be inserted.  Details on how the maximum size/size of
    the in-band OAM domain are retrieved are outside the scope of this
    document.
 
    Let n = max number of nodes to be allocated;
    (Based on PMTU advertised in the domain)
 
    Let k = number of node data that can be allocated by this node
    Let node_data_size = size of each node_data based on in-band OAM type
 
    if (packet matches traffic for which in-band OAM is enabled) {
        Create in-band OAM hbyh ext header with k node data preallocated
        Increment payload length in IPv6 header :
                          with size of in-band OAM hbyh ext header
        Populate node data at :
            (size of in-band OAM hbyh header = 8) + k * node_data_size
        from the beginning of the header
        Set segments left to : k - 1
 
     }
 
 3.1.3.  Procedure at Intermediate Nodes
 
    If a network node receives a packet with an in-band OAM header and it
    is enabled to process in-band OAM data it performs the following:
 
    k = number of node data that this node can allocate
    if (in-band OAM ext hbyh header is present) {
        if (Segments Left > 0)) {
          populate node data at :
             node_data_start[Segments Left]
          Segments Left = Segments Left - 1
        }
    }
 
 3.1.4.  Procedure at the Egress Edge to Remove the In-band OAM Header
 
    egress_edge = list of interfaces where in-band OAM hbyh ext
                   header is to be stripped
    Before forwarding packet out of interfaces in egress_edge list:
    if (in-band OAM hbyh ext header is present) {
       remove the in-band OAM hbyh ext header,
       possibly store the record along with additional
       fields for analysis and export
       Decrement Payload Length in IPv6 header
       by size of in-band OAM ext header
    }
 
 4.  In-band OAM Metadata Transport in VXLAN-GPE
 
    VXLAN-GPE [I-D.ietf-nvo3-vxlan-gpe] encapsulation is somewhat similar
    to IPv6 extension headers in that a series of headers can be
    contained in the header as a linked list.  The different in-band OAM
    types are added as options within a new in-band OAM protocol header
    in VXLAN GPE.
 
    In-band OAM header in VXLAN GPE header:
 
     0                   1                   2                   3

    |                                                               |

    |                                                               |
    |                                                               |
    |                                                               |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
 
    The VXLAN-GPE header and fields are defined in
    [I-D.ietf-nvo3-vxlan-gpe]. in-band OAM specific fields and header are
    defined here:
 
    Type:  8-bit unsigned integer defining in-band OAM header type
 
    in-band OAM HDR len:  8-bit unsigned integer.  Length of the in-band
       OAM HDR in 8-octet units
 
    in-band OAM options:  Variable-length field, of length such that the
       complete in-band OAM header is an integer multiple of 8 octets
       long.  Contains one or more TLV-encoded options of the format:
 
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+- - - - - - - - -
    |  Option Type  |  Opt Data Len |  Option Data
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+- - - - - - - - -
 
       Option Type          8-bit identifier of the type of option.
 
       Opt Data Len         8-bit unsigned integer.  Length of the Option
                            Data field of this option, in octets.
 
       Option Data          Variable-length field.  Option-Type-specific
                            data.
 
    The in-band OAM options defined in [draft-brockners-inband-oam-data]
    are encoded with an option type allocated in the new in-band OAM IANA
    registry - in-band OAM_PROTOCOL_OPTION_REGISTRY_IANA_TBD.  In
    addition the following padding options are defined to be used when
    necessary to align subsequent options and to pad out the containing
    header to a multiple of 8 octets in length.
 
    Pad1 option  (alignment requirement: none)
 
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
        |       0       |
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
        NOTE: The format of the Pad1 option is a special case -- it does
              not have length and value fields.
 
        The Pad1 option is used to insert one octet of padding into the
        Options area of a header.  If more than one octet of padding is
        required, the PadN option, described next, should be used, rather
        than multiple Pad1 options.
 
    PadN option  (alignment requirement: none)
 
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+- - - - - - - - -
        |       1       |  Opt Data Len |  Option Data
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+- - - - - - - - -
        The PadN option is used to insert two or more octets of padding
        into the Options area of a header.  For N octets of padding, the
        Opt Data Len field contains the value N-2, and the Option Data
        consists of N-2 zero-valued octets.
 
 5.  In-band OAM Metadata Transport in NSH
 
    In Service Function Chaining (SFC) [RFC7665], the Network Service
    Header (NSH) [I-D.ietf-sfc-nsh] already includes path tracing
    capabilities [I-D.penno-sfc-trace], but currently does not offer a
    solution to securely prove that packets really traversed the service
    chain.  The "Proof of Transit" capabilities (see
    [draft-brockners-inband-oam-requirements] and
    [draft-brockners-proof-of-transit]) of in-band OAM can be leveraged

    TLV Class:  Describes the scope of the "Type" field.  In some cases,
       the TLV Class will identify a specific vendor, in others, the TLV
       Class will identify specific standards body allocated types.  POT
       is currently defined using the Cisco (0x0009) TLV class.
 
    Type:  The specific type of information being carried, within the
       scope of a given TLV Class.  Value allocation is the
       responsibility of the TLV Class owner.  Currently a type value of
       0x94 is used for proof of transit
 
    Reserved bits:  Two reserved bit are present for future use.  The
       reserved bits MUST be set to 0x0.
 
    F: One bit.  Indicates which POT-profile is active. 0 means the even
       POT-profile is active, 1 means the odd POT-profile is active.
 
    Length:  Length of the variable metadata, in 4-octet words.  Here the
       length is 4.
 
    Random:  64-bit Per packet Random number.
 
    Cumulative:  64-bit Cumulative that is updated by the Service
       Functions.
 
 6.  In-band OAM Metadata Transport in Segment Routing
 
 6.1.  In-band OAM in SR with IPv6 Transport
 
    Similar to NSH, a service chain or path defined using Segment Routing
    for IPv6 can be verified using the in-band OAM "Proof of Transit"
    approach.  The Segment Routing Header (SRH) for IPv6 offers the
    ability to transport TLV structured data, similar to what NSH does
    (see [I-D.ietf-6man-segment-routing-header]).  A new "POT TLV" is
    defined for the SRH which is to carry proof of transit in-band OAM
    data.

    Type:  To be assigned by IANA.
 
    Length:  18.
 
    RESERVED:  8 bits.  SHOULD be unset on transmission and MUST be
       ignored on receipt.
 
    F: 1 bit.  Indicates which POT-profile is active. 0 means the even
       POT-profile is active, 1 means the odd POT-profile is active.
 
    Flags:  8 bits.  No flags are defined in this document.
 
    Random:  64-bit per packet random number.
 
    Cumulative:  64-bit cumulative value that is updated at specific
       nodes that form the service path to be verified.
 
 6.2.  In-band OAM in SR with MPLS Transport
 
    In-band OAM "Proof of Transit" data can also be carried as part of
    the MPLS label stack.  Details will be addressed in a future version
    of this document.
 
 7.  IANA Considerations
 
    IANA considerations will be added in a future version of this
    document.
 
 8.  Manageability Considerations
 
    Manageability considerations will be addressed in a later version of
    this document..
 
 9.  Security Considerations
 
    Security considerations will be addressed in a later version of this
    document.  For a discussion of security requirements of in-band OAM,
