1.  Introduction

   In-situ OAM (IOAM) records OAM information within the packet while
   the packet traverses a particular network domain.  The term "in-situ"
   refers to the fact that the OAM data is added to the data packets
   rather than is being sent within packets specifically dedicated to
   OAM.  This document defines how IOAM data fields are transported as
   part of the Network Service Header (NSH) [RFC8300] encapsulation.
   The IOAM data fields are defined in [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].  An
   implementation of IOAM which leverages NSH to carry the IOAM data is
   available from the FD.io open source software project [FD.io].

3.  IOAM data fields encapsulation in NSH

   NSH is defined in [RFC8300].  IOAM data fields are carried in NSH
   using a next protocol header which follows the NSH MDx metadata TLVs.
   An IOAM header is added containing the different IOAM data fields
   defined in [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].  In an administrative domain
   where IOAM is used, insertion of the IOAM header in NSH is enabled at
   the NSH tunnel endpoints, which also serve as IOAM encapsulating/
   decapsulating nodes by means of configuration.

   The NSH header and fields are defined in [RFC8300].  The "NSH Next
   Protocol" value (referred to as "NP" in the diagram above) is
   TBD_IOAM.

   The IOAM related fields in NSH are defined as follows:

   IOAM-Type:  8-bit field defining the IOAM Option type, as defined in
      Section 7.2 of [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].

   IOAM HDR Len:  8 bit Length field contains the length of the IOAM
      header in 4-octet units.

   Reserved bits:  Reserved bits are present for future use.  The
      reserved bits MUST be set to 0x0 upon transmission and ignored
      upon receipt.

   Next Protocol:  8-bit unsigned integer that determines the type of
      header following IOAM protocol.

   IOAM Option and Data Space:  IOAM option header and data is present
      as specified by the IOAM-Type field, and is defined in Section 4
      of [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].

   Multiple IOAM options MAY be included within the NSH encapsulation.
   For example, if a NSH encapsulation contains two IOAM options before
   a data payload, the Next Protocol field of the first IOAM option will
   contain the value of TBD_IOAM, while the Next Protocol field of the
   second IOAM option will contain the "NSH Next Protocol" number
   indicating the type of the data payload.

4.  Considerations

   This section summarizes a set of considerations on the overall
   approach taken for IOAM data encapsulation in NSH, as well as
   deployment considerations.

4.1.  Discussion of the encapsulation approach

   This section is to support the working group discussion in selecting
   the most appropriate approach for encapsulating IOAM data fields in
   NSH.

   An encapsulation of IOAM data fields in NSH should be friendly to an
   implementation in both hardware as well as software forwarders and
   support a wide range of deployment cases, including large networks
   that desire to leverage multiple IOAM data fields at the same time.

      Hardware and software friendly implementation: Hardware forwarders
      benefit from an encapsulation that minimizes iterative look-ups of
      fields within the packet: Any operation which looks up the value
      of a field within the packet, based on which another lookup is
      performed, consumes additional gates and time in an implementation
      - both of which are desired to be kept to a minimum.  This means
      that flat TLV structures are to be preferred over nested TLV
      structures.  IOAM data fields are grouped into three option
      categories: Trace, proof-of-transit, and edge-to-edge.  Each of
      these three options defines a TLV structure.  A hardware-friendly
      encapsulation approach avoids grouping these three option
      categories into yet another TLV structure, but would rather carry
      the options as a serial sequence.

      Total length of the IOAM data fields: The total length of IOAM
      data can grow quite large in case multiple different IOAM data
      fields are used and large path-lengths need to be considered.  If
      for example an operator would consider using the IOAM trace option
      and capture node-id, app_data, egress/ingress interface-id,
      timestamp seconds, timestamps nanoseconds at every hop, then a
      total of 20 octets would be added to the packet at every hop.  In
      case this particular deployment would have a maximum path length
      of 15 hops in the IOAM domain, then a maximum of 300 octets of
      IOAM data were to be encapsulated in the packet.

Internet-Draft        In-situ OAM NSH encapsulation           March 2018


   Different approaches for encapsulating IOAM data fields in NSH could
   be considered:

   1.  Encapsulation of IOAM data fields as "NSH MD Type 2" (see
       [RFC8300], section 2.5).  Each IOAM data field option (trace,
       proof-of-transit, and edge-to-edge) would be specified by a type,
       with the different IOAM data fields being TLVs within this the
       particular option type.  NSH MD Type 2 offers support for
       variable length meta-data.  The length field is 6-bits, resulting
       in a maximum of 256 (2^6 x 4) octets.

   2.  Encapsulation of IOAM data fields using the "Next Protocol"
       field.  Each IOAM data field option (trace, proof-of-transit, and
       edge-to-edge) would be specified by its own "next protocol".

   3.  Encapsulation of IOAM data fields using the "Next Protocol"
       field.  A single NSH protocol type code point would be allocated
       for IOAM.  A "sub-type" field would then specify what IOAM
       options type (trace, proof-of-transit, edge-to-edge) is carried.

   The third option has been chosen here.  This option avoids the
   additional layer of TLV nesting that the use of NSH MD Type 2 would
   result in.  In addition, this option does not constrain IOAM data to
   a maximum of 256 octets, thus allowing support for very large
   deployments.

4.2.  IOAM and the use of the NSH O-bit

   [RFC8300] defines an "O bit" for OAM packets.  Per [RFC8300] the O
   bit must be set for OAM packets and must not be set for non-OAM
   packets.  Packets with IOAM data included MUST follow this
   definition, i.e. the O bit MUST NOT be set for regular customer
   traffic which also carries IOAM data and the O bit MUST be set for
   OAM packets which carry only IOAM data without any regular data
   payload.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate protocol numbers for the following "NSH
   Next Protocol" related to IOAM:

                 +---------------+-------------+---------------+
                 | Next Protocol | Description | Reference     |
                 +---------------+-------------+---------------+
                 | x             | TBD_IOAM    | This document |
                 +---------------+-------------+---------------+

Internet-Draft        In-situ OAM NSH encapsulation           March 2018


6.  Security Considerations

   IOAM is considered a "per domain" feature, where one or several
   operators decide on leveraging and configuring IOAM according to
   their needs.  Still, operators need to properly secure the IOAM
   domain to avoid malicious configuration and use, which could include
   injecting malicious IOAM packets into a domain.
