1.  Introduction

   In-situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM) records
   operational and telemetry information in the packet while the packet
   traverses a path between two points in the network.
   [I-D.ioametal-ippm-6man-ioam-ipv6-options] defines how IOAM data
   fields are encapsulated in the IPv6 [RFC8200].  This document
   discusses deployment options for networks which leverage IOAM data
   fields encapsulated in the IPv6 protocol.

   Deployment considerations differ, whether the IOAM domain starts and
   ends on hosts or whether the IOAM encapsulating and decapsulating
   nodes are network devices that forward traffic, such as routers.

3.  Considerations for IOAM deployment in IPv6 networks

   IOAM deployment in an IPv6 network should take the following
   considerations and requirements into account:

   C1 It is desirable that the addition of IOAM data fields neither
      changes the way routers forward the packets, nor the forwarding
      decision the routers takes.  The packet with the added OAM
      information should follow the same path within the domain that the
      same packet without the OAM information would follow within the
      domain even in the presence of ECMP.  Such a behavior is
      particularly interesting for deployments where IOAM data fields
      are only added "on-demand", e.g. to provide further insights in
      case of undesired network behavior for certain flows.
      Implementations of IOAM should ensure that ECMP behavior for
      packets with and without IOAM data fields is the same.

   C2 Given that IOAM data fields increase the total size of the packet,
      the size of the packet including the IOAM data could exceed the
      PMTU.  In particular, the incremental trace IOAM HbH Option, which
      is proposed to support hardware implementations of IOAM, changes
      Option Data Length en-route.  Operators of an IOAM domain are to
      ensure that the addition of OAM information does not lead to
      fragmentation of the packet, e.g. by configuring the MTU of



Bhandari, et al.        Expires January 28, 2021                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft       In-situ OAM IPv6 encapsulation            July 2020


      transit routers and switches to a sufficiently high value.
      Careful control of the MTU in a network is one of the reasons why
      IOAM is considered a domain specific feature, see also
      [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].  In addition, the PMTU tolerance range
      in the IOAM domain should be identified (e.g. through
      configuration) and IOAM encapsulation operations and/or IOAM data
      field insertion (in case of incremental tracing) should not be
      performed if it exceeds the packet size beyond PMTU.

   C3 Packets with IOAM data or associated ICMP errors, should not
      arrive at destinations which have no knowledge of IOAM.  Consider
      using IOAM in transit devices; misleading ICMP errors due to
      addition and/or presence of OAM data in the packet can confuse a
      source of the packet that did not insert the OAM information.

   C4 OAM data leaks may affect the forwarding behavior and state of
      network elements outside an IOAM domain.  IOAM domains SHOULD
      provide a mechanism to prevent data leaks or be able to assure
      that upon leak network elements outside the domain are not
      affected i.e they continue to process other valid packets.

   C5 The source of that inserted and leaked the IOAM data must be easy
      to identify for the purpose of troubleshooting, due to the high
      complexity of troubleshooting a source that inserted the IOAM data
      and did not remove it when the packet traversed across an AS.
      Such a troubleshooting process may require coordination between
      multiple operators, complicated configuration verification, packet
      capture analysis, etc.

   C6 Compliance with [RFC8200] would require OAM data to be
      encapsulated instead of header/option insertion directly into in-
      flight packets using the original IPv6 header.

4.  IOAM domains bounded by hosts

   For deployments where the IOAM domain is bounded by hosts, hosts will
   perform the operation of IOAM data field encapsulation and
   decapsulation.  IOAM data is carried in IPv6 packets as Hop-by-Hop or
   Destination options, see [I-D.ioametal-ippm-6man-ioam-ipv6-options].

5.  IOAM domains bounded by network devices

   For deployments where the IOAM domain is bounded by network devices,
   network devices such as routers form the edge of an IOAM domain.
   Network devices will perform the operation of IOAM data field
   encapsulation and decapsulation.

5.1.  Deployment options

   This section lists out possible deployment options that can be
   employed to meet the requirements listed in Section 3.

5.1.1.  IPv6-in-IPv6 encapsulation

   Leverage an IPv6-in-IPv6 approach: Preserve the original IP packet
   and add an IPv6 header including IOAM data fields in an extension
   header in front of it, to forward traffic within and across the IOAM
   domain.  The overlay network formed by the additional IPv6 header
   with the IOAM data fields included in an extension header is referred
   to as IOAM Overlay Network (ION) in this document.

   1.  Perform an IPv6-in-IPv6 approach.  The source address of the
       outer IPv6 header is that of the IOAM encapsulating node.  The
       destination address of the outer IPv6 header is the same as the
       inner IPv6 destination address, i.e. the destination address of
       the packet does not change.

   2.  To simplify debugging in case of leaked IOAM data fields in
       packets, consider a new IOAM E2E destination option to identify
       the Source IOAM domain (AS, v6 prefix).  Insert this option into
       the IOAM destination options EH attached to the outer IPv6
       header.  This additional information would allow for easy
       identification of an AS operator that is the source of packets
       with leaked IOAM information.  Note that leaked packets with IOAM
       data fields would only occur in case a router would be
       misconfigured.  [I-D.ioametal-ippm-6man-ioam-ipv6-options]
       requires that by default, packets with extension headers which
       carry IOAM data fields are dropped unless the router's interfaces
       are explicitly configured for IOAM.

   3.  All the IOAM options are defined with type "00 - skip over this
       option and continue processing the header.  So presence of the
       options must not cause packet drop in the network elements that
       do not understand the option.  In addition
       [I-D.ietf-6man-hbh-header-handling] should be considered.

5.1.2.  IP-in-IPv6 encapsulation with ULA

   The "IP-in-IPv6 encapsulation with ULA" [RFC4193] approach can be
   used to apply IOAM to an IPv6 as well as an IPv4 network.  In
   addition, it fulfills requirement C4 (avoid leaks) by using ULA for
   the ION.  Similar to the IPv6-in-IPv6 encapsulation approach above,
   the original IP packet is preserved.  An IPv6 header including IOAM
   data fields in an extension header is added in front of it, to
   forward traffic within and across the IOAM domain.  IPv6 addresses



Bhandari, et al.        Expires January 28, 2021                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft       In-situ OAM IPv6 encapsulation            July 2020


   for the ION, i.e. the outer IPv6 addresses are assigned from the ULA
   space.  Addressing and routing in the ION are to be configured so
   that the IP-in-IPv6 encapsulated packets follow the same path as the
   original, non-encapsulated packet would have taken.  This would
   create an internal IPv6 forwarding topology using the IOAM domain's
   interior ULA address space which is parallel with the forwarding
   topology that exists with the non-IOAM address space (the topology
   and address space that would be followed by packets that do not have
   supplemental IOAM information).  Establishment and maintenance of the
   parallel IOAM ULA forwarding topology could be automated, e.g.
   similar to how LDP [RFC5036] is used in MPLS to establish and
   maintain an LSP forwarding topology that is parallel to the network's
   IGP forwarding topology.

   Transit across the ION could leverage the transit approach for
   traffic between BGP border routers, as described in [RFC1772], "A.2.3
   Encapsulation".  Assuming that the operational guidelines specified
   in Section 4 of [RFC4193] are properly followed, the probability of
   leaks in this approach will be almost close to zero.  If the packets
   do leak through IOAM egress device misconfiguration or partial IOAM
   egress device failure, the packets' ULA destination address is
   invalid outside of the IOAM domain.  There is no exterior destination
   to be reached, and the packets will be dropped when they encounter
   either a router external to the IOAM domain that has a packet filter
   that drops packets with ULA destinations, or a router that does not
   have a default route.

5.1.3.  x-in-IPv6 Encapsulation that is used Independently

   In some cases it is desirable to monitor a domain that uses an
   overlay network that is deployed independently of the need for IOAM,
   e.g., an overlay network that runs Geneve-in-IPv6, or VXLAN-in-IPv6.
   In this case IOAM can be encapsulated in as an extension header in
   the tunnel (outer) IPv6 header.  Thus, the tunnel encapsulating node
   is also the IOAM encapsulating node, and the tunnel end point is also
   the IOAM decapsulating node.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document discusses the deployment of IOAM with IPv6 options.
   Security considerations of the specific IOAM data fields are
   described in [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].

7.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations that apply to this document.
