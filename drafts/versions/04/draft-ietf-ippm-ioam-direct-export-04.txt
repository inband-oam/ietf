                      In-situ OAM Direct Exporting
                 draft-ietf-ippm-ioam-direct-export-04

Abstract

   In-situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM) is used
   for recording and collecting operational and telemetry information.
   Specifically, IOAM allows telemetry data to be pushed into data
   packets while they traverse the network.  This document introduces a
   new IOAM option type called the Direct Export (DEX) option, which is
   used as a trigger for IOAM data to be directly exported or locally
   aggregated without being pushed into in-flight data packets.  The
   exporting method and format are outside the scope of this document.

1.  Introduction

   IOAM [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data] is used for monitoring traffic in the
   network, and for incorporating IOAM data fields into in-flight data
   packets.

   IOAM makes use of four possible IOAM options, defined in
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data]: Pre-allocated Trace Option, Incremental
   Trace Option, Proof of Transit (POT) Option, and Edge-to-Edge Option.

Internet-Draft            IOAM Direct Exporting                July 2021


   This document defines a new IOAM option type (also known as an IOAM
   type) called the Direct Export (DEX) option.  This option is used as
   a trigger for IOAM nodes to locally aggregate and process IOAM data,
   and/or to export it to a receiving entity (or entities).  A
   "receiving entity" in this context can be, for example, an external
   collector, analyzer, controller, decapsulating node, or a software
   module in one of the IOAM nodes.

   Note that even though the IOAM Option-Type is called "Direct Export",
   it depends on the deployment whether the receipt of a packet with DEX
   option type leads to the creation of another packet.  Some
   deployments might simply use the packet with the DEX option type to
   trigger local processing of OAM data.

   This draft has evolved from combining some of the concepts of PBT-I
   from [I-D.song-ippm-postcard-based-telemetry] with immediate
   exporting from [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-flags].

3.  The Direct Exporting (DEX) IOAM Option Type

3.1.  Overview

   The DEX option is used as a trigger for collecting IOAM data locally
   or for exporting it to a receiving entity (or entities).
   Specifically, the DEX option can be used as a trigger for collecting
   IOAM data by an IOAM node and locally aggregating it; thus, this
   aggregated data can be periodically pushed to a receiving entity, or
   pulled by a receiving entity on-demand.

   This option is incorporated into data packets by an IOAM
   encapsulating node, and removed by an IOAM decapsulating node, as
   illustrated in Figure 1.  The option can be read but not modified by
   transit nodes.  Note: the terms IOAM encapsulating, decapsulating and
   transit nodes are as defined in [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].

                        Figure 1: DEX Architecture

   The DEX option is used as a trigger to collect and/or export IOAM
   data.  The trigger applies to transit nodes, the decapsulating node,
   and the encapsulating node:

   o  An IOAM encapsulating node configured to incorporate the DEX
      option encapsulates (possibly a subset of) the packets it forwards
      with the DEX option, and MAY export and/or collect the requested
      IOAM data immediately.  Only IOAM encapsulating nodes are allowed
      to add the DEX option type to a packet.

   o  A transit node that processes a packet with the DEX option MAY
      export and/or collect the requested IOAM data.

   o  An IOAM decapsulating node that processes a packet with the DEX
      option MAY export and/or collect the requested IOAM data, and MUST
      decapsulate the IOAM header.

   As in [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data], the DEX option can be incorporated
   into all or a subset of the traffic that is forwarded by the
   encapsulating node, as further discussed in Section 3.1.1 below.
   Moreover, IOAM nodes respond to the DEX trigger by exporting and/or

   collection IOAM data either for all traversing packets that carry the
   DEX option, or selectively only for a subset of these packets, as
   further discussed in Section 3.1.2 below.

3.1.1.  DEX Packet Selection

   If an IOAM encapsulating node incorporates the DEX option into all
   the traffic it forwards it may lead to an excessive amount of
   exported data, which may overload the network and the receiving
   entity.  Therefore, an IOAM encapsulating node that supports the DEX
   option MUST support the ability to incorporate the DEX option
   selectively into a subset of the packets that are forwarded by it.

   Various methods of packet selection and sampling have been previously
   defined, such as [RFC7014] and [RFC5475].  Similar techniques can be
   applied by an IOAM encapsulating node to apply DEX to a subset of the
   forwarded traffic.

   The subset of traffic that is forwarded or transmitted with a DEX
   option SHOULD not exceed 1/N of the interface capacity on any of the
   IOAM encapsulating node's interfaces.  It is noted that this
   requirement applies to the total traffic that incorporates a DEX
   option, including traffic that is forwarded by the IOAM encapsulating
   node and probe packets that are generated by the IOAM encapsulating
   node.  In this context N is a parameter that can be configurable by
   network operators.  If there is an upper bound, M, on the number of
   IOAM transit nodes in any path in the network, then it is recommended
   to use an N such that N >> M.  The rationale is that a packet that
   includes a DEX option may trigger an exported packet from each IOAM
   transit node along the path for a total of M exported packets.  Thus,
   if N >> M then the number of exported packets is significantly lower
   than the number of data packets forwarded by the IOAM encapsulating
   node.  If there is no prior knowledge about the network topology or
   size, it is recommended to use N>100.

3.1.2.  Responding to the DEX Trigger

   The DEX option specifies which data fields should be exported and/or
   collected, as specified in Section 3.2.  As mentioned above, the data
   can be locally collected, and optionally can be aggregated and
   exported to a receiving entity, either proactively or on-demand.  If
   IOAM data is exported, the format and encapsulation of the packet
   that contains the exported data is not within the scope of the
   current document.  For example, the export format can be based on
   [I-D.spiegel-ippm-ioam-rawexport].

   An IOAM node that performs DEX-triggered exporting MUST support the
   ability to limit the rate of the exported packets.  The rate of

Internet-Draft            IOAM Direct Exporting                July 2021


   exported packets SHOULD be limited so that the number of exported
   packets is significantly lower than the number of packets that are
   exported by the device.  The exported data rate SHOULD not exceed 1/N
   of the interface capacity on any of the IOAM node's interfaces.  It
   is recommended to use N>100.  Depending on the IOAM node's
   architecture considerations, the export rate may be limited to a
   lower number in order to avoid loading the IOAM node.

   Exported packets SHOULD not be exported over a path or a tunnel that
   is subject to IOAM direct exporting.  Furthermore, IOAM encapsulating
   nodes that push a DEX option into traversing packets MUST avoid
   pushing an IOAM header into IOAM exported packets.  This requirement
   is intended to prevent nested exporting and/or exporting loops.

   A transit IOAM node that does not support the DEX option SHOULD
   ignore it.  A decapsulating node that does not support the DEX option
   MUST remove it, along with any other IOAM options carried in the
   packet if such exist.

3.2.  The DEX Option Format

   The format of the DEX option is depicted in Figure 2.  The length of
   the DEX option is either 8 octets or 16 octets, as the Flow ID and
   the Sequence Number fields (summing up to 8 octets) are optional.  It
   is assumed that the lower layer protocol indicates the length of the
   DEX option, thus indicating whether the two optional fields are
   present.

   Flags           A 16-bit field, comprised of 16 one-bit subfields.
                   Flags are allocated by IANA, as defined in
                   Section 4.2.

   IOAM-Trace-Type A 24-bit identifier which specifies which data fields
                   should be exported.  The format of this field is as
                   defined in [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].  Specifically,
                   bit 23, which corresponds to the Checksum Complement
                   data field, should be assigned to be zero by the IOAM
                   encapsulating node, and ignored by transit and
                   decapsulating nodes.  The reason for this is that the
                   Checksum Complement is intended for in-flight packet
                   modifications and is not relevant for direct
                   exporting.

   Reserved        This field SHOULD be ignored by the receiver.

   Flow ID         A 32-bit flow identifier.  If the actual Flow ID is
                   shorter than 32 bits, it is zero padded in its most
                   significant bits.  The field is set at the
                   encapsulating node.  The Flow ID can be uniformly
                   assigned by a central controller or algorithmically
                   generated by the encapsulating node.  The latter
                   approach cannot guarantee the uniqueness of Flow ID,
                   yet the conflict probability is small due to the
                   large Flow ID space.  The Flow ID can be used to
                   correlate the exported data of the same flow from
                   multiple nodes and from multiple packets.

   Sequence Number A 32-bit sequence number starting from 0 and
                   increasing by 1 for each following monitored packet
                   from the same flow at the encapsulating node.  The
                   Sequence Number, when combined with the Flow ID,
                   provides a convenient approach to correlate the
                   exported data from the same user packet.

4.  IANA Considerations

4.1.  IOAM Type

   The "IOAM Type Registry" was defined in Section 7.2 of
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].  IANA is requested to allocate the
   following code point from the "IOAM Type Registry" as follows:

   TBD-type   IOAM Direct Export (DEX) Option Type

   If possible, IANA is requested to allocate code point 4 (TBD-type).

Internet-Draft            IOAM Direct Exporting                July 2021


4.2.  IOAM DEX Flags

   IANA is requested to define an "IOAM DEX Flags" registry.  This
   registry includes 16 flag bits.  Allocation should be performed based
   on the "RFC Required" procedure, as defined in [RFC8126].

5.  Performance Considerations

   The DEX option triggers IOAM data to be collected and/or exported
   packets to be exported to a receiving entity (or entities).  In some
   cases this may impact the receiving entity's performance, or the
   performance along the paths leading to it.

   Therefore, the performance impact of these exported packets is
   limited by taking two measures: at the encapsulating nodes, by
   selective DEX encapsulation (Section 3.1.1), and at the transit
   nodes, by limiting exporting rate (Section 3.1.2).  These two
   measures ensure that direct exporting is used at a rate that does not
   significantly affect the network bandwidth, and does not overload the
   receiving entity.  Moreover, it is possible to load balance the
   exported data among multiple receiving entities, although the
   exporting method is not within the scope of this document.

6.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of IOAM in general are discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].  Specifically, an attacker may try to use
   the functionality that is defined in this document to attack the
   network.

   An attacker may attempt to overload network devices by injecting
   synthetic packets that include the DEX option.  Similarly, an on-path
   attacker may maliciously incorporate the DEX option into transit
   packets, or maliciously remove it from packets in which it is
   incorporated.

   Forcing DEX, either in synthetic packets or in transit packets may
   overload the receiving entity (or entities).  Since this mechanism
   affects multiple devices along the network path, it potentially
   amplifies the effect on the network bandwidth and on the receiving
   entity's load.

   The amplification effect of DEX may be worse in wide area networks in
   which there are multiple IOAM domains.  For example, if DEX is used
   in IOAM domain 1 for exporting IOAM data to a receiving entity, then
   the exported packets of domain 1 can be forwarded through IOAM domain
   2, in which they are subject to DEX.  The exported packets of domain
   2 may in turn be forwarded through another IOAM domain (or through

   domain 1), and theoretically this recursive amplification may
   continue infinitely.

   In order to mitigate the attacks described above, the following
   requirements (Section 3) have been defined:

   o  Selective DEX (Section 3.1.1) is applied by IOAM encpsulating
      nodes in order to limit the potential impact of DEX attacks to a
      small fraction of the traffic.

   o  Rate limiting of exported traffic (Section 3.1.2) is applied by
      IOAM nodes in order to prevent overloading attacks and in order to
      significantly limit the scale of amplification attacks.

   o  IOAM encapsulating nodes are required to avoid pushing the DEX
      option into IOAM exported packets (Section 3.1.2), thus preventing
      some of the amplification and export loop scenarios.

   Although the exporting method is not within the scope of this
   document, any exporting method MUST secure the exported data from the
   IOAM node to the receiving entity.  Specifically, an IOAM node that
   performs DEX exporting MUST send the exported data to a pre-
   configured trusted receiving entity.

   IOAM is assumed to be deployed in a restricted administrative domain,
   thus limiting the scope of the threats above and their affect.  This
   is a fundamental assumption with respect to the security aspects of
   IOAM, as further discussed in [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].

Appendix A.  Hop Limit and Hop Count in Direct Exporting

   In order to help correlate and order the exported packets, it is
   possible to include the Hop_Lim/Node_ID data field in exported
   packets; if the IOAM-Trace-Type [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data] has the
   Hop_Lim/Node_ID bit set, then exported packets include the Hop_Lim/
   Node_ID data field, which contains the TTL/Hop Limit value from a
   lower layer protocol.

   An alternative approach was considered during the design of this
   document, according to which a 1-octet Hop Count field would be
   included in the DEX header (presumably by claiming some space from
   the Flags field).  The Hop Limit would starts from 0 at the
   encapsulating node and be incremented by each IOAM transit node that

   supports the DEX option.  In this approach the Hop Count field value
   would also be included in the exported packet.

   The main advantage of the Hop_Lim/Node_ID approach is that it
   provides information about the current hop count without requiring
   each transit node to modify the DEX option, thus simplifying the data
   plane functionality of Direct Exporting.  The main advantage of the
   Hop Count approach that was considered is that it counts the number
   of IOAM-capable nodes without relying on the lower layer TTL,
   especially when the lower layer cannot prvide the accurate TTL
   information, e.g., Layer 2 Ethernet or hierarchical VPN.  The Hop
   Count approach would also explicitly allow to detect a case where an
   IOAM-capable node fails to export packets.  It would also be possible
   to use a flag to indicate an optional Hop Count field, which enables
   to control the tradeoff.  On one hand it would address the use cases
   that the Hop_Lim/Node_ID cannot cover, and on the other hand it would
   not require transit switches to update the option if it was not
   supported or disabled.  For the sake of simplicity the Hop Count
   approach was not pursued, and this field is not incorporated in the
   DEX header.
