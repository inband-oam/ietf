                      Data Formats for In-situ OAM
                   draft-brockners-inband-oam-data-03

Abstract

   In-situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM) records
   operational and telemetry information in the packet while the packet
   traverses a path between two points in the network.  This document
   discusses the data types and data formats for in-situ OAM data
   records.  In-situ OAM data records can be embedded into a variety of
   transports such as NSH, Segment Routing, VXLAN-GPE, Geneve, native
   IPv6 (via extension header), or IPv4.  In-situ OAM can be used to
   complement current out-of-band OAM mechanisms based on ICMP or other
   types of probe packets.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines data record types for "in-situ" Operations,
   Administration, and Maintenance (OAM).  In-situ OAM records OAM
   information within the packet while the packet traverses a particular

   network domain.  The term "in-situ" refers to the fact that the OAM
   data is added to the data packets rather than is being sent within
   packets specifically dedicated to OAM.  A discussion of the
   motivation and requirements for in-situ OAM can be found in
   [I-D.brockners-inband-oam-requirements].  In-situ OAM is to
   complement "out-of-band" or "active" mechanisms such as Ping or
   Traceroute, or more recent active probing mechanisms as described in
   [I-D.lapukhov-dataplane-probe].  In-situ OAM mechanisms can be
   leveraged where current out-of-band mechanisms do not apply or do not
   offer the desired results, such as proving that a certain traffic
   flow takes a pre-defined path, SLA verification for the live data
   traffic, detailed statistics on traffic distribution paths in
   networks that distribute traffic across multiple paths, or scenarios
   in which probe traffic is potentially handled differently from
   regular data traffic by the network devices.

   This document defines the data types and data formats for in-situ OAM
   data records.  The in-situ OAM data records can be transported by a
   variety of transport protocols, including NSH, Segment Routing,
   VXLAN-GPE, Geneve, IPv6, or IPv4.  Encapsulation details for these
   different transport protocols are outside the scope of this document.

3.  In-situ OAM Data Types and Data Format

   This section defines in-situ OAM data types and data formats of the
   data records required for in-situ OAM.  The different uses of in-situ
   OAM require the definition of different types of data.  The in-situ
   OAM data format for the data being carried corresponds to the three
   main categories of in-situ OAM data defined in
   [I-D.brockners-inband-oam-requirements], which are: edge-to-edge, per
   node, and for selected nodes only.

   Transport options for in-situ OAM data are outside the scope of this
   memo, and are discussed in [I-D.brockners-inband-oam-transport].  In-
   situ OAM data is defined as options in Type-Length-Value (TLV)
   format.  The TLV format for each of the three different types of in-
   situ OAM data is defined in this document.

   In-situ OAM is expected to be deployed in a specific domain rather
   than on the overall Internet.  The part of the network which employs
   in- situ OAM is referred to as the "in-situ OAM-domain".  In-situ OAM
   data is added to a packet upon entering the in-situ OAM-domain and is
   removed from the packet when exiting the domain.  Within the in-situ
   OAM-domain, the in-situ OAM data may be updated by network nodes that
   the packet traverses.  The device which adds an in-situ OAM data
   container to the packet to capture in-situ OAM data is called the
   "in-situ OAM encapsulating node", whereas the device which removes
   the in-situ OAM data container is referred to as the "in-situ OAM
   decapsulating node".  Nodes within the domain which are aware of in-
   situ OAM data and read and/or write or process the in-situ OAM data
   are called "in-situ OAM transit nodes".  Note that not every node in
   an in-situ OAM domain needs to be an in-situ OAM transit node.  For
   example, a Segment Routing deployment might require the segment
   routing path to be verified.  In that case, only the SR nodes would
   also be in-situ OAM transit nodes rather than all nodes.

3.1.  In-situ OAM Tracing Options

   "In-situ OAM tracing data" is expected to be collected at every node
   that a packet traverses, i.e., in a typical deployment all nodes in
   an in-situ OAM-domain would participate in in-situ OAM and thus be
   in-situ OAM transit nodes, in-situ OAM encapsulating or in-situ OAM
   decapsulating nodes.  The maximum number of hops and the minimum path
   MTU of the in-situ OAM domain is assumed to be known.

   To optimize hardware and software implementations tracing is defined
   as two separate options.  Any deployment MAY choose to configure and



Brockners, et al.       Expires September 9, 2017               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft          In-situ OAM Data Formats              March 2017


   support one or both of the following options.  An implementation of
   the transport protocol that carries these in-situ OAM data MAY choose
   to support only one of the options.  In the event that both options
   are utilized at the same time, the Incremental Trace Option MUST be
   placed before the Pre-allocated Trace Option.

   Pre-allocated Trace Option:  This trace option is defined as a
      container of node-data elements with pre-allocated space for each
      node to populate its information.  This option is useful for
      software implementations where it is efficient to allocate the
      space once and index into the array to populate the data during
      transit.  The in-situ OAM encapsulating node allocates the option
      header and sets the fields in the option header.  The in situ OAM
      encapsulating node allocates an array which is used to store
      operational data retrieved from every node while the packet
      traverses the domain.  In-situ OAM transit nodes update the
      content of the array.  A pointer which is part of the in-situ OAM
      trace data points to the next empty slot in the array, which is
      where the next in-situ OAM transit node fills in its data.

   Incremental Trace Option:  This trace option is defined as a
      container of node-data elements where each node allocates and
      pushes its node data immediately following the option header.  The
      number of node-data elements recorded and maximum number of node
      data that can be recorded are written into the option header.
      This format of trace recording is useful for some of the hardware
      implementations as this eliminates the need for the transit
      network elements to read the full array in the option and allows
      for arbitrarily long packets as the MTU allows.  The in-situ OAM
      encapsulating node allocates the option header.  The in-situ OAM
      encapsulating node based on operational state and configuration
      sets the fields in the header to control how large the node data
      list can grow.  In-situ OAM transit nodes push their node data to
      the node data list and increment the number of node data records
      in the header.

   Every node data entry is to hold information for a particular in-situ
   OAM transit node that is traversed by a packet.  The in-situ OAM
   decapsulating node removes the in-situ OAM data and processes and/or
   exports the metadata.  In-situ OAM data uses its own name-space for
   information such as node identifier or interface identifier.  This
   allows for a domain-specific definition and interpretation.  For
   example: In one case an interface-id could point to a physical
   interface (e.g., to understand which physical interface of an
   aggregated link is used when receiving or transmitting a packet)
   whereas in another case it could refer to a logical interface (e.g.,
   in case of tunnels).

   The following in-situ OAM data is defined for in-situ OAM tracing:

   o  Identification of the in-situ OAM node.  An in-situ OAM node
      identifier can match to a device identifier or a particular
      control point or subsystem within a device.

   o  Identification of the interface that a packet was received on.

   o  Identification of the interface that a packet was sent out on.

   o  Time of day when the packet was processed by the node.  Different
      definitions of processing time are feasible and expected, though
      it is important that all devices of an in-situ OAM domain follow
      the same definition.

   o  Generic data: Format-free information where syntax and semantic of
      the information is defined by the operator in a specific
      deployment.  For a specific deployment, all in-situ OAM nodes
      should interpret the generic data the same way.  Examples for
      generic in-situ OAM data include geo-location information
      (location of the node at the time the packet was processed),
      buffer queue fill level or cache fill level at the time the packet
      was processed, or even a battery charge level.

   o  A mechanism to detect whether in-situ OAM trace data was added at
      every hop or whether certain hops in the domain weren't in-situ
      OAM transit nodes.

   The "Node data List" array in the packet is populated iteratively as
   the packet traverses the network, starting with the last entry of the
   array, i.e., "Node data List [n]" is the first entry to be populated,
   "Node data List [n-1]" is the second one, etc.

   IOAM-Trace-Type:  16-bit identifier of a particular trace element
      variant.

      The trace type value is a bit field.  The following bit fields are
      defined in this document, with details on each field described in
      the Section 3.1.4.  The order of packing the trace data in each
      Node-data element follows the bit order for setting each trace
      data element.

      Bit 0    (Least significant bit) When set indicates presence of
               Hop_Lim and node_id in the Node data.

      Bit 1    When set indicates presence of ingress_if_id and
               egress_if_id (short format) in the Node data.

      Within an in-situ OAM domain possible combinations of these bits
      making the IOAM-Trace-Type can be restricted by configuration

   Octets-left:  8-bit unsigned integer.  It is the data space in octets
      remaining for recording the node data.  This is used as an offset
      in octets in data space to record node data element.

         by the network element if there is not enough number of bytes
         left to record node data, no record is added and the overflow
         "O-bit" must be set to "1" in the header.  This is useful for
         transit nodes to ignore further processing of the option.

      Bit 1  "Loopback" (L-bit).  Loopback mode is used to send a copy
         of a packet back towards the source.  Loopback mode assumes

         that a return path from transit nodes and destination nodes
         towards the source exists.  The encapsulating node decides
         (e.g. using a filter) which packets loopback mode is enabled
         for by setting the loopback bit.  The encapsulating node also
         needs to ensure that sufficient space is available in the IOAM
         header for loopback operation.  The loopback bit when set
         indicates to the transit nodes processing this option to create
         a copy of the packet received and send this copy of the packet
         back to the source of the packet while it continues to forward
         the original packet towards the destination.  The source
         address of the original packet is used as destination address
         in the copied packet.  The address of the node performing the
         copy operation is used as the source address.  The L-bit MUST
         be cleared in the copy of the packet a nodes sends it back
         towards the source.  On its way back towards the source, the
         packet is processed like a regular packet with IOAM
         information.  Once the return packet reaches the IOAM domain
         boundary IOAM decapsulation occurs as with any other packet
         containing IOAM information.

   Node data List [n]:  Variable-length field.  The format of which is
      determined by the IOAM-Trace-Type representing the n-th Node data
      in the Node data List.  The Node data List is encoded starting
      from the last Node data of the path.  The first element of the
      node data list (Node data List [0]) contains the last node of the
      path while the last node data of the Node data List (Node data
      List[n]) contains the first Node data of the path traced.  The
      index contained in "Octets-left" identifies the offset for current
      active Node data to be populated.

   IOAM-trace-type:  16-bit identifier of a particular trace element
      variant.

      The trace type value is a bit field.  The following bit fields are
      defined in this document, with details on each field described in
      the Section 3.1.4.  The order of packing the trace data in each
      Node-data element follows the bit order for setting each trace
      data element.

      Bit 0    When set indicates presence of Hop_Lim and node_id in the
               Node data.

      Bit 1    When set indicates presence of ingress_if_id and
               egress_if_id in the Node data.

               data.

      Bit 11-15  Undefined in this draft.

      Section 3.1.5 describes the format of a number of trace types.

   Maximum Length:  8-bit unsigned integer.  This field specifies the
      maximum length of the node data list in octets.  Given that the
      sender knows the minimum path MTU, the sender can set the maximum
      of node data bytes allowed before exceeding the MTU.  Thus, a
      simple comparison between "Opt data Len" and "Max Length" allows
      to decide whether or not data could be added.

   Flags  8-bit field.  Following flags are defined:

      Bit 0  "Overflow" (O-bit) (least significant bit).  This bit is
         set by the network element if there is not enough number of
         bytes left to record node data, no record is added and the
         overflow "O-bit" must be set to "1" in the header.  This is
         useful for transit nodes to ignore further processing of the
         option.

      Bit 1  "Loopback" (L-bit).  This bit when set indicates to the
         transit nodes processing this option to send a copy of the

         packet back to the source of the packet while it continues to
         forward the original packet towards the destination.  The L-bit
         MUST be cleared in the copy of the packet before sending it.

   Node data List [n]:  Variable-length field.  The format of which is
      determined by the OAM Type representing the n-th Node data in the
      Node data List.  The Node data List is encoded starting from the
      last Node data of the path.  The first element of the node data
      list (Node data List [0]) contains the last node of the path while
      the last node data of the Node data List (Node data List[n])
      contains the first Node data of the path traced.

3.1.4.  In-situ OAM node data element format

   All the data records MUST be 4-byte aligned.  The IOAM encapsulating
   node MUST initialize data records that it adds to the packet to zero.
   If a node which is supposed to update an IOAM data record is not
   capable of populating the value of a field set in the iOAM-trace-
   type, the field value MUST be left unaltered except when explicitly
   specified in the field description below.  In the description of data
   record field below if zero is valid value then a non-zero value to
   mean not populated is specified.

   Data type and format for each of the data records is shown below:

   Hop_Lim and node_id:  4-octet field defined as follows:

    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |   Hop_Lim     |              node_id                          |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

      Hop_Lim:  1-octet unsigned integer.  It is set to the Hop Limit
         value in the packet at the node that records this data.  Hop
         Limit information is used to identify the location of the node
         in the communication path.  This is copied from the lower
         layer, e.g., TTL value in IPv4 header or hop limit field from
         IPv6 header of the packet when the packet is ready for
         transmission.

      node_id:  3-octet unsigned integer.  Node identifier field to
         uniquely identify a node within in-situ OAM domain.  The
         procedure to allocate, manage and map the node_ids is beyond
         the scope of this document.

   ingress_if_id and egress_if_id:  4-octet field defined as follows:
      When this field is part of the data record but a node populating

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

      ingress_if_id:  2-octet unsigned integer.  Interface identifier to
         record the ingress interface the packet was received on.

      egress_if_id:  2-octet unsigned integer.  Interface identifier to
         record the egress interface the packet is forwarded out of.

   timestamp seconds:  4-octet unsigned integer.  Absolute timestamp in
      seconds that specifies the time at which the packet was received
      by the node.  The format of this field is identical to the most
      significant 32 bits of the 64 least significant bits of the
      [IEEE1588v2] timestamp format.  This truncated format consists of
      a 32-bit seconds field.  As defined in [IEEE1588v2], the timestamp
      specifies the number of seconds elapsed since 1 January 1970
      00:00:00 according to the International Atomic Time (TAI).

    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   timestamp nanoseconds:  4-octet unsigned integer in the range 0 to
      10^9-1.  This timestamp specifies the fractional part of the wall
      clock time at which the packet was received by the node in units
      of nanoseconds.  The format of this field is identical to the 32
      least significant bits of the [IEEE1588v2] timestamp format.  This
      fields allows for delay computation between any two nodes in the
      network when the nodes are time synchronized.  When this field is
      part of the data record but a node populating the record is not
      able to fill it, the field position in the record must be filled
      with value 0xFFFF to mean not populated.

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   transit delay:  4-octet unsigned integer in the range 0 to 2^30-1.
      It is the time in nanoseconds the packet spent in the transit
      node.  This can serve as an indication of the queuing delay at the
      node.  If the transit delay exceeds 2^30-1 nanoseconds then the

      top bit 'O' is set to indicate overflow.  When this field is part
      of the data record but a node populating the record is not able to

   app_data:  4-octet placeholder which can be used by the node to add
      application specific data

   queue depth:  4-octet unsigned integer field.  This field indicates
      the current length of the egress interface queue of the interface
      from where the packet is forwarded out.  The queue depth is
      expressed as the current number of packets (i.e.  number of
      currently used packet buffers) in the queue.  When this field is
      part of the data record but a node populating the record is not
      able to fill it, the field position in the record must be filled
      with value 0xFFFF to mean not populated.

   Opaque State Snapshot:  Variable length field.  It allows the network
      element to store an arbitrary state in the node data record,
      without a pre-defined schema.  The schema needs to be made known
      to the analyzer by some out-of-band means.  The 24-bit "Schema Id"
      field in the record indicates which particular schema is used, and
      should be configured on the network element by the operator.

      Length:  1-octet unsigned integer.  It is the length in octets of
         the Opaque data field that follows Schema Id.  It MUST always
         be a multiple of 4.

      Schema ID:  3-octet unsigned integer identifying the schema of

      Hop_Lim:  1-octet unsigned integer.  It is set to the Hop Limit
         value in the packet at the node that records this data.  Hop
         Limit information is used to identify the location of the node
         in the communication path.  This is copied from the lower layer
         for e.g.  TTL value in IPv4 header or hop limit field from IPv6
         header of the packet.

      node_id:  7-octet unsigned integer.  Node identifier field to
         uniquely identify a node within in-situ OAM domain.  The
         procedure to allocate, manage and map the node_ids is beyond
         the scope of this document.

      follows: When this field is part of the data record but a node
      populating the record is not able to fill it, the field position
      in the record must be filled with value 0xFFFFFFFF to mean not

   app_data wide:  8-octet placeholder which can be used by the node to
      add application specific data.

3.1.5.  Examples of In-situ OAM node data

   An entry in the "Node data List" array can have different formats,
   following the needs of the deployment.  Some deployments might only
   be interested in recording the node identifiers, whereas others might
   be interested in recording node identifier and timestamp.  The
   section defines different formats that an entry in "Node data List"
   can take.

   0x002B:  In-situ OAM-trace-type is 0x2B then the format of node data
      is:

3.2.  In-situ OAM Proof of Transit Option

   In-situ OAM Proof of Transit data is to support the path or service
   function chain [RFC7665] verification use cases.  Proof-of-transit
   uses methods like nested hashing or nested encryption of the in-situ
   OAM data or mechanisms such as Shamir's Secret Sharing Schema (SSSS).
   While details on how the in-situ OAM data for the proof of transit
   option is processed at in-situ OAM encapsulating, decapsulating and
   transit nodes are outside the scope of the document, all of these
   approaches share the need to uniquely identify a packet as well as
   iteratively operate on a set of information that is handed from node
   to node.  Correspondingly, two pieces of information are added as in-
   situ OAM data to the packet:

   o  Random: Unique identifier for the packet (e.g., 64-bits allow for
      the unique identification of 2^64 packets).

   o  Cumulative: Information which is handed from node to node and
      updated by every node according to a verification algorithm.

   IOAM POT Type:  7-bit identifier of a particular POT variant that
      dictates the POT data that is included.  This document defines POT
      Type 0:

      0: POT data is a 16 Octet field as described below.

   Profile to use (P):  1-bit.  Indicates which POT-profile is used to
      generate the Cumulative.  Any node participating in POT will have
      a maximum of 2 profiles configured that drive the computation of
      cumulative.  The two profiles are numbered 0, 1.  This bit conveys
      whether profile 0 or profile 1 is used to compute the Cumulative.

   Random:  64-bit Per packet Random number.

   Cumulative:  64-bit Cumulative that is updated at specific nodes by
      processing per packet Random number field and configured
      parameters.

   Note: Larger or smaller sizes of "Random" and "Cumulative" data are
   feasible and could be required for certain deployments (e.g.  in case
   of space constraints in the transport protocol used).  Future
   versions of this document will address different sizes of data for
   "proof of transit".

3.3.  In-situ OAM Edge-to-Edge Option

   The in-situ OAM Edge-to-Edge Option is to carry data which is to be
   interpreted only by the in-situ OAM encapsulating and in-situ OAM
   decapsulating node, but not by in-situ OAM transit nodes.

   Currently only sequence numbers use the in-situ OAM Edge-to-Edge
   option.  In order to detect packet loss, packet reordering, or packet
   duplication in an in-situ OAM-domain, sequence numbers can be added
   to packets of a particular tube (see
   [I-D.hildebrand-spud-prototype]).  Each tube leverages a dedicated
   namespace for its sequence numbers.

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   IOAM-E2E-Type:  8-bit identifier of a particular in situ OAM E2E
      variant.

         0: E2E option data is a 64-bit sequence number added to a
         specific tube which is used to identify packet loss and
         reordering for that tube.

4.  In-situ OAM Data Export

   In-situ OAM nodes collect information for packets traversing a domain
   that supports in-situ OAM.  The device at the domain edge (which
   could also be an end-host) which receives a packet with in-situ OAM
   information chooses how to process the in-situ OAM data collected
   within the packet.  This decapsulating node can simply discard the
   information collected, can process the information further, or export
   the information using e.g., IPFIX.
