1.  Introduction

   In-situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM) records
   operational and telemetry information in the packet while the packet
   traverses a path between two points in the network.
   [I-D.ioametal-ippm-6man-ioam-ipv6-options] defines how IOAM data
   fields are encapsulated in the IPv6 [RFC8200].  This document
   discusses deployment options for networks which leverage IOAM data
   fields encapsulated in the IPv6 protocol.

   Deployment considerations differ, whether the IOAM domain starts and
   ends on hosts or whether the IOAM encapsulating and decapsulating
   nodes are network devices that forward traffic, such as routers.

3.  Considerations for IOAM deployment in IPv6 networks

   IOAM deployment in an IPv6 network should take the following
   considerations and requirements into account:

   C1 It is desirable that the addition of IOAM data fields neither
      changes the way routers forward the packets, nor the forwarding
      decision the routers takes.  The packet with the added OAM
      information should follow the same path within the domain that the
      same packet without the OAM information would follow within the
      domain even in the presence of ECMP.  Such a behavior is
      particularly interesting for deployments where IOAM data fields
      are only added "on-demand", e.g. to provide further insights in
      case of undesired network behavior for certain flows.
      Implementations of IOAM should ensure that ECMP behavior for
      packets with and without IOAM data fields is the same.

   C2 Given that IOAM data fields increase the total size of the packet,
      the packet size could exceed the PMTU.  In particular, the
      incremental trace IOAM HbH Option, which is proposed to support
      hardware implementations of IOAM, changes Option Data Length en-
      route.  Operators of an IOAM domain are to ensure that the
      addition of OAM information does not lead to fragmentation of the
      packet.  Careful control of the MTU in a network is one of the

Internet-Draft       In-situ OAM IPv6 encapsulation        February 2019


      reasons why IOAM is considered a domain specific feature, see also
      [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].  In addition, the PMTU tolerance range
      in the IOAM domain should be identified (e.g.  through
      configuration) and IOAM encapsulation operations and/or IOAM data
      field insertion (in case of incremental tracing) should not be
      performed if it exceeds the packet size beyond PMTU.

   C3 Packets with IOAM data or associated ICMP errors, should not
      arrive at destinations which have no knowledge of IOAM.  Consider
      using IOAM in a transit network: Misleading ICMP errors due to
      addition and/or presence of OAM data in the packet can confuse a
      source of the packet that did not insert the OAM information.

   C4 OAM data leaks may affect the forwarding behavior and state of
      network elements outside an IOAM domain.  Build a mechanism to
      prevent data leaks or be able to assure that upon leak network
      elements outside the domain are not affected i.e continue to
      process other valid packets.

   C5 Source OAM domain that inserted and leaked OAM data must be easy
      to identify for purpose of troubleshooting.  For e.g.  It very
      time consuming to troubleshoot source that inserted the EH but
      didn't remove when the packet traverses across AS (you have to
      walk the AS path, contacting each operator, asking them to verify
      their config, get packet captures etc.), and all the while you may
      have a number of angry customers/end-users.

   C6 Compliance with [RFC8200] would require OAM data to be
      encapsulated instead of header/option insertion into in-flight
      packets.

4.  IOAM domains bounded by hosts

   For deployments where the IOAM domain is bounded by hosts, hosts will
   perform the operation of IOAM data field encapsulation and
   decapsulation.  IOAM data is carried in IPv6 packets as Hop-by-Hop or
   Destination options, see [I-D.ioametal-ippm-6man-ioam-ipv6-options].

5.  IOAM domains bounded by network devices

   For deployments where the IOAM domain is bounded by network devices,
   network devices such as routers form the edge of an IOAM domain.
   Network devices will perform the operation of IOAM data field
   encapsulation and decapsulation.

5.1.  Deployment options

   This section lists out possible deployment options that can be
   employed to meet the requirements listed in Section 3.

5.1.1.  IPv6-in-IPv6 encapsulation

   Leverage an IPv6-in-IPv6 approach: Preserve the original IP packet
   and add an IPv6 header including IOAM data fields in an extension
   header in front of it, to forward traffic within and across the IOAM
   domain.  The overlay network formed by the additional IPv6 header
   with the IOAM data fields included in an extension header is referred
   to as IOAM Overlay Network (ION) in this document.

   1.  Perform an IPv6-in-IPv6 approach.  The source address of the
       outer IPv6 header is that of the IOAM encapsulating node.  The
       destination address of the outer IPv6 header is the same as the
       inner IPv6 destination address, i.e. the destination address of
       the packet does not change.

   2.  To simplify debugging in case of leaked IOAM data fields in
       packets, consider a new IOAM E2E destination option to identify
       the Source IOAM domain (AS, v6 prefix).  Insert this option into
       the IOAM destination options EH attached to the outer IPv6
       header.  This additional information would allow for easy
       identification of an AS operator that is the source of packets
       with leaked IOAM information.

   3.  All the IOAM options are defined with type "00 - skip over this
       option and continue processing the header.  So presence of the
       options must not cause packet drop in the network elements that
       do not understand the option.  In addition
       [I-D.ietf-6man-hbh-header-handling] should be considered.

5.1.2.  IP-in-IPv6 encapsulation with ULA

   The "IP-in-IPv6 encapsulation with ULA" approach can be used to apply
   IOAM to an IPv6 as well as an IPv4 network.  In addition, it fulfills
   requirement C4 (avoid leaks) by using ULA for the ION.  Similar to
   the IPv6-in-IPv6 encapsulation approach above, the original IP packet
   is preserved.  An IPv6 header including IOAM data fields in an
   extension header is added in front of it, to forward traffic within
   and across the IOAM domain.  IPv6 addresses for the ION, i.e. the
   outer IPv6 addresses are assigned from the ULA space.  Addressing and
   routing in the ION are to be configured so that the IP-in-IPv6
   encapsulated packets follow the same path as the original, non-
   encapsulated packet would have taken.  Transit across the ION could

   leverage the transit approach for traffic between BGP border routers,
   as described in RFC1772, "A.2.3 Encapsulation".

6.  Security Considerations

   This document discusses the deployment of IOAM with IPv6 options.
   Security considerations of the specific IOAM data fields are
   described in [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].

7.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations that apply to this document.
