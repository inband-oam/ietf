1.  Introduction

   In-situ OAM (IOAM) records OAM information within the packet while
   the packet traverses a particular network domain.  The term "in-situ"
   refers to the fact that the IOAM data fields are added to the data
   packets rather than being sent within packets specifically dedicated
   to OAM.  This document defines how IOAM data fields are transported
   as part of the VXLAN-GPE [I-D.ietf-nvo3-vxlan-gpe] encapsulation.
   The IOAM data fields are defined in [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].  An
   implementation of IOAM which leverages VXLAN-GPE to carry the IOAM
   data is available from the FD.io open source software project
   [FD.io].

3.  IOAM Data Field Encapsulation in VXLAN-GPE

   VXLAN-GPE is defined in [I-D.ietf-nvo3-vxlan-gpe].  IOAM data fields
   are carried in VXLAN-GPE using a next protocol header of TBD_IOAM.
   The different IOAM data fields defined in [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data]
   are added as TLVs.  In an administrative domain where IOAM is used,
   insertion of the IOAM protocol header in VXLAN-GPE is enabled at the
   VXLAN-GPE tunnel endpoints which also serve as IOAM encapsulating/
   decapsulating nodes by means of configuration.

              Figure 1: IOAM data encapsulation in VXLAN-GPE

   The VXLAN-GPE header and fields are defined in
   [I-D.ietf-nvo3-vxlan-gpe].  The VXLAN Next Protocol value for IOAM is
   TBD_IOAM.

   The IOAM related fields in VXLAN-GPE are defined as follows:

   IOAM-Type:  8-bit field defining the IOAM Option type, as defined in
      Section 7.2 of [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].

   IOAM HDR len:  8-bit unsigned integer.  Length of the IOAM HDR in
      4-octet units.

   Reserved:  8-bit reserved field MUST be set to zero.

   Next Protocol:  8-bit unsigned integer that determines the type of
      header following IOAM protocol.  The value is from the IANA

      registry setup for VXLAN GPE Next Protocol defined in
      [I-D.ietf-nvo3-vxlan-gpe].

   IOAM Option and Data Space:  IOAM option header and data is present
      as defined by the IOAM-Type field, and is defined in Section 4 of
      [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].

   Multiple IOAM options MAY be included within the VXLAN-GPE
   encapsulation.  For example, if a VXLAN-GPE encapsulation contains
   two IOAM options before a data payload, the Next Protocol field of
   the first IOAM option will contain the value of TBD_IOAM, while the
   Next Protocol field of the second IOAM option will contain the VXLAN
   "Next Protocol" number indicating the type of the data payload.

4.  Considerations

   This section summarizes a set of considerations on the overall
   approach taken for IOAM data encapsulation in VXLAN-GPE, as well as
   deployment considerations.

4.1.  Discussion of the encapsulation approach

   This section is to support the working group discussion in selecting
   the most appropriate approach for encapsulating IOAM data fields in
   VXLAN-GPE.

   An encapsulation of IOAM data fields in VXLAN-GPE should be friendly
   to an implementation in both hardware as well as software forwarders.
   Hardware forwarders benefit from an encapsulation that minimizes
   iterative look-ups of fields within the packet: Any operation which
   looks up the value of a field within the packet, based on which
   another lookup is performed, consumes additional gates and time in an
   implementation - both of which are desired to be kept to a minimum.
   This means that flat TLV structures are to be preferred over nested
   TLV structures.  IOAM data fields are grouped into three option
   categories: Trace, proof-of-transit, and edge-to-edge.  Each of these
   three options defines a TLV structure.  A hardware-friendly
   encapsulation approach avoids grouping these three option categories
   into yet another TLV structure, but would rather carry the options as
   a serial sequence.

   Two approaches for encapsulating IOAM data fields in VXLAN-GPE could
   be considered:

   1.  Use a single GPE protocol type for all IOAM types: IOAM would
       receive a single GPE protocol type code point.  A "sub-type"
       (e.g.  4 bit wide) would then specify what IOAM options type(s)
       (trace, proof-of-transit, edge-to-edge) are carried.  In case



Brockners, et al.       Expires September 4, 2018               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft     In-situ OAM VXLAN-GPE encapsulation        March 2018


       there is a need for additional IOAM options, changes would be
       contained within the single GPE protocol type for IOAM.

   2.  Use one GPE protocol type per IOAM options type: Each IOAM data
       field option (trace, proof-of-transit, and edge-to-edge) would be
       specified by its own "next protocol", i.e. each IOAM options type
       becomes its own GPE protocol type with a dedicated code point.
       This implies that in case additional IOAM option types would be
       added in the future, additional GPE protocol type code points
       would need to be allocated.

   The second option has been chosen here, because it avoids the
   additional layer of TLV nesting that the use of a single GPE protocol
   type for all IOAM option types would result in.

4.2.  IOAM and the use of the VXLAN O-bit

   [I-D.ietf-nvo3-vxlan-gpe] defines an "O bit" for OAM packets.  Per
   [I-D.ietf-nvo3-vxlan-gpe] the O bit indicates that the packet
   contains an OAM message instead of data payload.  Packets with IOAM
   data do not change the use of the O bit: The O bit would be set of
   OAM packets which carry IOAM data fields and would not be set of
   regular data payload / customer traffic which carries IOAM data
   fields.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate a protocol number for the following
   VXLAN-GPE "Next Protocols" related to IOAM:

                 +---------------+-------------+---------------+
                 | Next Protocol | Description | Reference     |
                 +---------------+-------------+---------------+
                 | x             | TBD_IOAM    | This document |
                 +---------------+-------------+---------------+


6.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of VXLAN-GPE are discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-nvo3-vxlan-gpe], and the security considerations of IOAM in
   general are discussed in [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].

   IOAM is considered a "per domain" feature, where one or several
   operators decide on leveraging and configuring IOAM according to
   their needs.  Still, operators need to properly secure the IOAM
   domain to avoid malicious configuration and use, which could include
   injecting malicious IOAM packets into a domain.
