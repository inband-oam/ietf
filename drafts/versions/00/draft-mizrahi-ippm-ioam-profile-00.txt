                   draft-mizrahi-ippm-ioam-profile-00

Abstract

   In Situ Operations, Administration and Maintenance (IOAM) is used for
   monitoring network performance and for detecting bottlenecks and
   anomalies by incorporating IOAM information into in-flight data
   packets.  This document introduces the concept of use case driven
   IOAM profiles.  An IOAM profile defines a use case or a set of use
   cases for IOAM, and a set of rules that restrict the scope and
   features of the IOAM specification to a subset of the full
   functionality.

1.  Introduction

   IOAM [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data] is used for monitoring traffic in the
   network by incorporating IOAM information into data packets.

   This document introduces the concept of use case driven IOAM
   profiles.  An IOAM profile defines a use case or a set of use cases

   for IOAM, and a set of rules that restrict the scope and features of
   the IOAM specification to a subset of the full functionality.  Based
   on the guidelines in this document, it is expected that future
   documents may define one or more IOAM profiles.  The current document
   does not specify any IOAM profiles.

   The motivation for defining profiles is to limit the scope of IOAM
   features, allowing simpler implementation, verification, and
   interoperability testing in the context of specific use cases that do
   not require the full functionality of IOAM.

   This document does not require any changes in IOAM
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].  Furthermore, it is expected that future
   IOAM profile specifications will not require changes in IOAM, since a
   profile, by definition, derives a subset of the existing
   functionality.

2.  Specifying an IOAM Profile

2.1.  Overview

   A profile defines a set of rules that limit the scope or
   functionality of IOAM.  By default, any detail in IOAM that is not
   specifically addressed or limited by the profile is as defined in
   IOAM [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].  The rest of this section presents a
   set of topics that may be addressed in a profile specification.  A
   profile may include some or all of these topics, and optionally other
   topics.

2.2.  Use Cases

   An IOAM profile should define the use case(s) for using the profile.
   The use case may describe deployment scenarios or specific
   applications that make use of IOAM data.  The use case should
   typically define the required functionality from IOAM.  For example,
   an IOAM profile may be defined such that it requires transit delay
   monitoring, but does not require path tracing.  These requirements
   then affect which IOAM data fields are used in the profile.

2.3.  Namespace-ID

   IOAM namespaces are defined in Section 4.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].  An IOAM profile can be bound to a
   specific Namespace-ID value or to a set of Namespace-ID values.
   Thus, a profile specification may request IANA to allocate one or
   more Namespace-ID values.

Internet-Draft                IOAM Profiles                   March 2019


   It should be noted that the Namespace-ID is typically used for other
   purposes, as specified in [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data], and thus the
   scope of a Namespace and the scope of an IOAM profile are generally
   independent.  However, some profiles may be defined in a way that
   binds the profile to a specific Namespace-ID value or to a specific
   Namespace-ID range.  Note that a profile may also be defined without
   being bound to a specific Namesampe-ID, in which case the profile
   specification may not include the current section.

2.4.  IOAM Options

   IOAM information may be represented in one of four possible IOAM
   options: Pre-allocated Trace Option, Incremental Trace Option, Proof
   Of Transit (POT) Option, and Edge-to-Edge Option.  An IOAM profile
   may specify a subset of allowed options.  A profile may define some
   options as mandatory in the current profile, or some options as
   forbidden in the current profile.

   For each IOAM option, a profile specification may limit the scope of
   the profile to certain features.  For example, a profile may be
   defined to use the Incremental Trace Option such that only specific
   data types are used in the profile, while others are not.

2.5.  IOAM Option Header Field Values

   An IOAM profile may define specific values or specific value range
   for some of the fields in the IOAM option headers.  For example, a
   profile may define a specific value that is allowed to be used in the
   Flags field of the trace option header.

2.6.  Opaque State Snapshot

   The Opaque State Snapshot, as defined in [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data],
   is a variable length field that may be used in IOAM trace options.
   The Opaque State Snapshot is defined in a flexible Type/Length/Value
   manner.  An IOAM profile may define a specific format for the Opaque
   State Snapshot including for example a specific length and a specific
   interpretation of the opaque data.

2.7.  Timestamp Format

   A profile may specify a specific timestamp format to be used in IOAM
   data fields.

2.8.  Profile Coexistence

   An IOAM node may be configured to operate in one or more IOAM
   profiles.  If more than one profile is enabled, there should be a way
   for IOAM nodes to distinguish between packets that use different IOAM
   profiles, e.g., using the Namespace-ID.  Therefore, it is recommended
   that a profile specification includes a definition of how to
   distinguish between packets from different profiles.

2.9.  Validity

   When an IOAM transit node or an IOAM decapsulating node receives a
   packet with one or more IOAM options, it needs to detect which
   profile the packet is bound to.  The node then needs to perform
   validity checks including verifying that the packet belongs to one of
   the profiles that is supported and enabled in the current node, and
   that all the IOAM options in the current packet conform to the
   profile specification.

   An IOAM transit/decapsulating node that receives a packet with IOAM
   options that do not pass the validity check can either forward/
   decapsulate the packet without IOAM processing, or it can process the
   packet as a conventional IOAM-enabled packet, if it is able to do so
   and if the network policy allows this behavior.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not include any requests from IANA.

4.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of IOAM in general are discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].  This document presents the concept of
   IOAM profiles; since an IOAM profile is a specific use case of IOAM,
   any security threat that is relevant to the profile is also relevant
   to the full-blown IOAM.  Therefore, the current document does not
   present any new security considerations beyond
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].  Moreover, in some cases a profile may
   limit the set of features of IOAM in a way that reduces the set of
   potential threats compared a full implementation of IOAM.

Appendix A.  An IOAM Profile Example

A.1.  Overview

   This section presents an example of an IOAM profile specification.
   The profile makes use of the Hop limit, Node ID and Transit delay
   data fields, and is thus called the HNT profile for short.

A.2.  Use Cases

   This profile is intended for path tracing and transit delay
   monitoring, while using compact data with just two data fields per
   packet.  The profile can be useful in networks with a large number of
   hops.

A.3.  IOAM Options

   The HNT profile makes use of the Incremental Trace Option.  A packet
   that includes IOAM data according to the current profile includes a
   single IOAM option - the Incremental Trace Option.  Specifically, two
   data fields are used in this profile: the Hop_Lim and node_id field,
   and the transit delay field.

A.4.  IOAM Option Header Field Values

   The IOAM-Trace-Type field in the header of the Incremental Trace
   Option in current profile has a fixed value; Bit 0 (the most
   significant bit) and Bit 4 are set, while the rest of the bits are
   zero, indicating the two data fields that are used in the option.

A.5.  Opaque State Snapshot

   The opaque state snapshot is never used in this profile.  Note that
   the NodeLen field, as defined in [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data],
   represents the length of the data excluding the opaque state

   snapshot.  Since this field is not used in the current profile, the
   NodeLen represents the actual length of the data.

A.6.  Profile Coexistence

   It is assumed that the current profile is used in a confined
   administrative domain in which no other IOAM profiles are used.
   Therefore, it is assumed that the current profile does not coexist
   with other profiles.

A.7.  Validity

   An IOAM transit/decapsulating node that receives a packet with IOAM
   options that do not comply to the current profile should forward/
   decapsulate the packet without IOAM processing, if it is able to do
   so.  If a decapsulating node is not able to decapsulate an IOAM
   option that is not compliant to the current profile, the packet is
   discarded.
