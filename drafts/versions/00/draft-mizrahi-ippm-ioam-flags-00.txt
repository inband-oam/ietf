Abstract

   In-situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM) records
   operational and telemetry information in the packet while the packet
   traverses a path between two points in the network.  This document
   presents a few use cases of active measurement using IOAM.
   Specifically, the document also defines the Active flag in IOAM Trace
   Options.

1.  Introduction

   IOAM [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data] is used for monitoring traffic in the
   network by incorporating IOAM data fields into in-flight data
   packets.

   Active measurement methods [RFC7799] make use of synthetically
   generated packets in order to facilitate the measurement.  This
   document presents use cases of active measurement using IOAM, and
   introduces a new IOAM flag, the Active flag, which is used to
   identify synthetic packets.

3.  Active Measurement with IOAM

3.1.  Use Cases

   An example of an IOAM deployment scenario is illustrated in Figure 1.
   The figure depicts two endpoints, a source and a destination.  The
   data traffic from the source to the destination is forwarded through
   a set of network devices, including an IOAM encapsulating node, which
   incorporates one or more IOAM option, a decapsulating node, which
   removes the IOAM options, optionally one or more transit nodes.  The
   IOAM options are encapsulated in one of the IOAM encapsulation types,
   e.g., [I-D.ietf-sfc-ioam-nsh], or
   [I-D.ioametal-ippm-6man-ioam-ipv6-options].

                       Figure 1: Network using IOAM.

   This draft focuses on three possible use cases of active measurement
   using IOAM.  These use cases are described using the example of
   Figure 1.

   o  Endpoint active measurement: synthetic probe packets are sent
      between the source and destination, traversing the IOAM domain.

Internet-Draft                 IOAM Flags                     March 2019


      Since the probe packets are sent between the endpoints, these
      packets are treated as data packets by the IOAM domain, and do not
      require special treatment at the IOAM layer.

   o  IOAM active measurement using probe packets: probe packets are
      generated and transmitted by the IOAM encapsulating node, and are
      expected to be terminated by the decapsulating node.  IOAM data
      related to probe packets may be exported by one or more nodes
      along its path, by an exporting protocol that is outside the scope
      of this document (e.g., [I-D.spiegel-ippm-ioam-rawexport]).  Probe
      packets include a Trace Option which has its Active flag set,
      indicating that the decapsulating node must terminate them.

   o  IOAM active measurement using replicated data packets: probe
      packets are created by the encapsulating node by selecting some or
      all of the en route data packets and replicating them.  A selected
      data packet that is replicated, and its (possibly truncated) copy
      is forwarded with one or more IOAM option, while the original
      packet is forwarded normally, without IOAM options.  To the extent
      possible, the original data packet and its replica are forwarded
      through the same path.  The replica includes a Trace Option that
      has its Active flag set, indicating that the decapsulating node
      should terminate it.

3.2.  The Active Flag

   IOAM data may be represented in one of four possible IOAM options:
   Pre-allocated Trace Option, Incremental Trace Option, Proof of
   Transit (POT) Option, and Edge-to-Edge Option.  This document defines
   the Active flag, which is a new flag in the Pre-allocated and
   Incremental Trace options.

   "Active" (A-bit).  When set, this indicates that this is an active
   IOAM packet, where "active" is used in the sense defined in
   [RFC7799], rather than a data packet.  The packet may be an IOAM
   probe packet, or a replicated data packet (the second and third use
   cases of Section 3.1).

   An IOAM decapsulating node that receives a packet with the Active
   flag set in one of its Trace options must terminate the packet.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests the following IANA Actions.

4.1.  Allocating the Active Flag

   IANA is requested to allocate bit 1 in the "IOAM Trace Flags
   Registry" as follows:

   Bit 1  "Active" (A-bit)

   Note that bit 0 is the most significant bit in the Flags Registry.

5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of IOAM in general are discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].
