3.  In-situ OAM Metadata Transport in IPv6

   An IPv6 option is defined corresponding to each of the IOAM data
   fields defined in [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].  This mechanisms of in-
   situ OAM in IPv6 is used to enhance diagnostics of IPv6 networks.  It
   complements other mechanisms proposed to enhance diagnostics of IPv6
   networks, such as the IPv6 Performance and Diagnostic Metrics
   Destination Option described in [RFC8250].  IOAM data is carried in
   IPv6 packets as Hop-by-Hop or Destination options as specified in the
   individual option definition below.

   IPv6 hop-by-hop and destination option format for carrying in-situ
   OAM data fields:

   Option Type          8-bit identifier of the type of option.

   Opt Data Len         8-bit unsigned integer.  Length of the
                        Reserved and Option Data field of this option,
                        in octets.

   Reserved (MBZ)       16-bit field MUST be filled with zeroes.

   Option Data          Variable-length field.  Option-Type-specific
                        data.


   In-situ OAM Options are inserted as Option data as follows:

   1.  Pre-allocated Tracing Option: The in-situ OAM Preallocated
       Tracing option defined in [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data] is
       represented as a IPv6 option in hop by hop extension header by
       allocating following type:

       Option Type:  001xxxxxx 8-bit identifier of the type of option.
          xxxxxx=TBD1.

   2.  Incremental Tracing Option: The in-situ OAM Incremental Tracing
       option defined in [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data] is represented as a
       IPv6 option in hop by hop extension header by allocating
       following type:

       Option Type:  001xxxxxx 8-bit identifier of the type of option.
          xxxxxx=TBD2.

Internet-Draft       In-situ OAM IPv6 encapsulation            June 2018


   3.  Proof of Transit Option: The in-situ OAM POT option defined in
       [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data] is represented as a IPv6 option in hop
       by hop extension header by allocating following type:

       Option Type:  001xxxxxx 8-bit identifier of the type of option.
          xxxxxx=TBD3.

   4.  Edge to Edge Option: The in-situ OAM E2E option defined in
       [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data] is represented as a IPv6 option in IPv6
       option in destination options extension header by allocating
       following type:

       Option Type:  000xxxxxx 8-bit identifier of the type of option.
          xxxxxx=TBD4.

   All the in-situ OAM IPv6 options defined here have alignment
   requirement.  Following the convention in IPv6, these options are
   aligned in a packet so that multi-octet values within the Option Data
   field of each option are 4-octet aligned as specified in
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].  In addition, to maintain IPv6 extenstion
   header 8-octet alignment requirement, Trace-Type for Incremental
   Tracing Option in IPv6 MUST be selected such that the IOAM node data
   length is a multiple of 8-octets.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document describes the encapsulation of IOAM data fields in
   IPv6.  Security considerations of the specific IOAM data fields for
   each case (i.e., Trace, Proof of Transit, and E2E) are described in
   defined in [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].

   As this document describes new options for IPv6 , these are similar
   to the security considerations of [RFC8200] and the new weakness
   documented in [RFC8250].

5.  IANA Considerations

   This draft requests the following IPv6 Option Type assignments from
   the Destination Options and Hop-by-Hop Options sub-registry of
   Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) Parameters.
