1.  Introduction

   In-situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM) records
   operational and telemetry information in the packet while the packet
   traverses a path between two points in the network.  This document
   outlines how IOAM data fields are encapsulated in the IPv6 [RFC8200]
   and discusses deployment options for networks that use
   IPv6-encapsulated IOAM data fields.  These options have distinct
   deployment considerations; for example, the IOAM domain can either be
   between hosts, or be between IOAM encapsulating and decapsulating
   network nodes that forward traffic, such as routers.

3.  In-situ OAM Metadata Transport in IPv6

   In-situ OAM in IPv6 is used to enhance diagnostics of IPv6 networks.
   It complements other mechanisms designed to enhance diagnostics of
   IPv6 networks, such as the IPv6 Performance and Diagnostic Metrics
   Destination Option described in [RFC8250].

   At the time this document was written, several implementations of
   IOAM i for IPv6 exist, e.g., IOAM for IPv6 in the Linux Kernel
   (supported from Kernel version 5.15 onwards IPv6 IOAM in Linux Kernel
   (https://github.com/torvalds/linux/
   commit/7c804e91df523a37c29e183ea2b10ac73c3a4f3d)), IOAM for IPv6 in
   VPP (https://docs.fd.io/vpp/17.04/ioam_ipv6_doc.html).

   IOAM data fields can be encapsulated with two types of extension
   headers in IPv6 packets - either Hop-by-Hop Options header or
   Destination options header.  Multiple options with the same Option
   Type MAY appear in the same Hop-by-Hop Options or Destination Options
   header, with distinct content.

   An IPv6 packet carrying IOAM data in an extension header can have
   other extension headers, compliant with [RFC8200].

   IPv6 Hop-by-Hop and Destination Option format for carrying in-situ
   OAM data fields:

   Option Type:  8-bit option type identifier as defined in Section 6.

   Opt Data Len:  8-bit unsigned integer.  Length of this option, in
      octets, not including the first 2 octets.

   Reserved:  8-bit field MUST be set to zero by the source.

   IOAM Type:  8-bit field as defined in section 7.1 in [RFC9197].

   Option Data:  Variable-length field.  Option-Type-specific data.

   IOAM Option data is inserted as follows:

   1.  Pre-allocated Trace Option: The IOAM Preallocated Trace Option-
       Type defined in Section 4.4 of [RFC9197] is represented as an
       IPv6 option in the Hop-by-Hop extension header:

       Option Type:  TBD_1_1 8-bit identifier of the IPv6 Option Type
          for IOAM.

          for IOAM.

       IOAM Type:  IOAM POT Option-Type.

   3.  Edge to Edge Option: The IOAM E2E option defined in Section 4.6
       [RFC9197] is represented as an IPv6 option in Destination
       extension header:

       Option Type:  TBD_1_0 8-bit identifier of the IPv6 Option Type
          for IOAM.

       IOAM Type:  IOAM E2E Option-Type.

   4.  Direct Export (DEX) Option: The IOAM Direct Export Option-Type
       defined in Section 3.2 of [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-direct-export] is
       represented as an IPv6 option in the Hop-by-Hop extension header:

       Option Type:  TBD_1_0 8-bit identifier of the IPv6 Option Type
          for IOAM.

       IOAM Type:  IOAM Direct Export (DEX) Option-Type.

   All the IOAM IPv6 options defined here have alignment requirements.
   Specifically, they all require 4n alignment.  This ensures that
   fields specified in [RFC9197] are aligned at a multiple-of-4 offset
   from the start of the Hop-by-Hop and Destination Options header.

   IPv6 options can have a maximum length of 255 octets.  Consequently,
   the total length of IOAM Option-Types including all data fields is
   also limited to 255 octets when encapsulated into IPv6.

4.  IOAM Deployment In IPv6 Networks


4.1.  Considerations for IOAM deployment and implementation in IPv6
      networks

   IOAM deployments in IPv6 networks MUST take the following
   considerations and requirements into account:

   C1  IOAM MUST be deployed as a limited domain feature as defined in
      [RFC8799].

   C2  Implementations of IOAM MUST ensure that the addition of IOAM
      data fields does not alter the way routers forward packets or the
      forwarding decisions they make.  Packets with added OAM
      information must follow the same path within the domain as an
      identical packet without OAM information would, even in the
      presence of Equal-Cost Multi-Path (ECMP).  This behavior is
      important for deployments where IOAM data fields are only added
      "on-demand".  Implementations of IOAM MUST ensure that ECMP
      behavior for packets with and without IOAM data fields is the

      same.  In order for IOAM to work in IPv6 networks, IOAM MUST be
      explicitly enabled per interface on every node within the IOAM
      domain.  Unless a particular interface is explicitly enabled
      (i.e., explicitly configured) for IOAM, a router MUST ignore IOAM
      Options.

   C3  In order to maintain the integrity of packets in an IOAM domain,
      the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) of transit routers and
      switches must be configured to a value that does not lead to an
      ICMP Packet Too Big error message being sent to the originator and
      the packet being dropped.  The PMTU tolerance range must be
      identified and IOAM encapsulation operations or data field
      insertion must not exceed this range.  Control of the MTU is
      critical to the proper operation of IOAM and is one of the reasons
      it is considered a limited domain feature (see also [RFC8799]).
      The PMTU tolerance must be identified through configuration and
      IOAM operations must not exceed the packet size beyond PMTU.

   C4  [RFC8200] precludes insertion of IOAM data directly into the
      original IPv6 header of in-flight packets.  IOAM deployments which
      do not encapsulate/decapsulate IOAM on the host but desire to
      encapsulate/decapsulate IOAM on transit nodes MUST add an
      additional IPv6 header to the original packet.  IOAM data is added
      to this additional IPv6 header.

4.2.  IOAM domains bounded by hosts

   For deployments where the IOAM domain is bounded by hosts, hosts will
   perform the operation of IOAM data field encapsulation and
   decapsulation.  IOAM data is carried in IPv6 packets as Hop-by-Hop or
   Destination options as specified in this document.

4.3.  IOAM domains bounded by network devices

   For deployments where the IOAM domain is bounded by network devices,
   network devices such as routers form the edge of an IOAM domain.
   Network devices will perform the operation of IOAM data field
   encapsulation and decapsulation.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document describes the encapsulation of IOAM data fields in
   IPv6.  Security considerations of the specific IOAM data fields for
   each case (i.e., Trace, Proof of Transit, and E2E) are described and
   defined in [RFC9197].

   As this document describes new options for IPv6, these are similar to
   the security considerations of [RFC8200] and the weakness documented
   in [RFC8250].

5.1.  Applicability of AH

   IOAM is a limited domain feature (refer to [RFC8799]).  The network
   devices in an IOAM domain are trusted to add, update and remove IOAM
   options according to the constraints specified in [RFC8200].  IOAM
   domain does not rely on the Authentication Header (AH) as defined in
   [RFC4302] to secure IOAM options.  The use of IOAM options with AH
   and its processing is not defined in this document.  Future documents
   may define use of IOAM with AH and its processing.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This draft requests the following IPv6 Option Type assignments from
   the Destination Options and Hop-by-Hop Options sub-registry of
   Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) Parameters.
