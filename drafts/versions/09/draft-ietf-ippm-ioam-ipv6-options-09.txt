1.  Introduction

   In-situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM) records
   operational and telemetry information in the packet while the packet
   traverses a path between two points in the network.  This document
   outlines how IOAM data fields are encapsulated in the IPv6 [RFC8200]
   and discusses deployment options for networks that use
   IPv6-encapsulated IOAM data fields.  These options have distinct
   deployment considerations; for example, the IOAM domain can either be
   between hosts, or be between IOAM encapsulating and decapsulating
   network nodes that forward traffic, such as routers.

   IOAM data fields can be encapsulated in "option data" fields using
   two types of extension headers in IPv6 packets - either Hop-by-Hop
   Options header or Destination options header.  Multiple options with
   the same Option Type MAY appear in the same Hop-by-Hop Options or
   Destination Options header, with distinct content.

   In order for IOAM to work in IPv6 networks, IOAM MUST be explicitly
   enabled per interface on every node within the IOAM domain.  Unless a
   particular interface is explicitly enabled (i.e., explicitly
   configured) for IOAM, a router MUST ignore IOAM Options.  As
   additional security, IOAM domains MUST provide a mechanism to prevent

   All the in-situ OAM IPv6 options defined here have alignment
   requirements.  Specifically, they all require 4n alignment.  This
   ensures that fields specified in [RFC9197] are aligned at a multiple-
   of-4 offset from the start of the Hop-by-Hop and Destination Options
   header.  In addition, to maintain IPv6 extension header 8-octet
   alignment and avoid the need to add or remove padding at every hop,
   the Trace-Type for Incremental Trace Option in IPv6 MUST be selected
   such that the IOAM node data length is a multiple of 8-octets.

   IPv6 options can have a maximum length of 255 octets.  Consequently,
   the total length of IOAM Option-Types including all data fields is
   also limited to 255 octets when encapsulated into IPv6.

5.1.  Considerations for IOAM deployment in IPv6 networks
>>>>>>> 7297220df6a9c5fe4f4418003affb9d3f7859479

   IOAM deployments in IPv6 networks should take the following
   considerations and requirements into account:

   C1  It is desirable that the addition of IOAM data fields neither
      changes the way routers forward packets nor the forwarding
      decisions the routers take.  Packets with added OAM information
      should follow the same path within the domain that an identical
      packet without OAM information would follow, even in the presence
      of ECMP.  Such behavior is particularly important for deployments
      where IOAM data fields are only added "on-demand", e.g., to
      provide further insights in case of undesired network behavior for
      certain flows.  Implementations of IOAM SHOULD ensure that ECMP
      behavior for packets with and without IOAM data fields is the
      same.

   C2  Given that IOAM data fields increase the total size of a packet,
      the size of a packet including the IOAM data could exceed the
      PMTU.  In particular, the incremental trace IOAM Hop-by-Hop (HbH)
      Option, which is intended to support hardware implementations of
      IOAM, changes Option Data Length en-route.  Operators of an IOAM
      domain SHOULD ensure that the addition of OAM information does not
      lead to fragmentation of the packet, e.g., by configuring the MTU
      of transit routers and switches to a sufficiently high value.
      Careful control of the MTU in a network is one of the reasons why

      IOAM is considered a domain-specific feature (see also [RFC9197]).
      In addition, the PMTU tolerance range in the IOAM domain should be
      identified (e.g., through configuration) and IOAM encapsulation
      operations and/or IOAM data field insertion (in case of
      incremental tracing) should not be performed if it exceeds the
      packet size beyond PMTU.

>>>>>>> 7297220df6a9c5fe4f4418003affb9d3f7859479
   C3  Packets with IOAM data or associated ICMP errors, should not
      arrive at destinations that have no knowledge of IOAM.  For
      example, if IOAM is used in in transit devices, misleading ICMP
      errors due to addition and/or presence of OAM data in a packet
      could confuse the host that sent the packet if it did not insert
      the OAM information.  The entities that communicate the errors to
      devices outside of the IOAM domain MUST remove any IOAM data from
      the packet included in the error message.

   C4  OAM data leaks can affect the forwarding behavior and state of
      network elements outside an IOAM domain.  IOAM domains MUST
      provide a mechanism to prevent data leaks or be able to ensure
      that if a leak occurs, network elements outside the domain are not
      affected (i.e., they continue to process other valid packets).

   C5  An Autonomous System (AS) that inserts and leaks the IOAM data
      needs to be easy to identify for the purpose of troubleshooting,
      due to the high complexity in identifying the source of the leak.
      Such a troubleshooting process might require coordination between
      multiple operators, complex configuration verification, packet
      capture analysis, etc.  This requirement may require additional
      option or fields to be defined to identify the domain that

>>>>>>> 7297220df6a9c5fe4f4418003affb9d3f7859479

   C6  Compliance with [RFC8200] requires OAM data to be encapsulated
      instead of header/option insertion directly into in-flight packets
      using the original IPv6 header.

   C7  The IOAM Incremental Trace Option-Type expands the option length
      that may affect the processing of extension headers and options
<<<<<<< HEAD
      that follow IOAM options.  Hence when the IOAM Incremental Trace
      Option-Type is used in the deployment the RemainingLen field of

      computed and set appropriately.

5.2.  IOAM domains bounded by hosts

   For deployments where the IOAM domain is bounded by hosts, hosts will
   perform the operation of IOAM data field encapsulation and
   decapsulation.  IOAM data is carried in IPv6 packets as Hop-by-Hop or
   Destination options as specified in this document.

5.3.  IOAM domains bounded by network devices

   For deployments where the IOAM domain is bounded by network devices,
   network devices such as routers form the edge of an IOAM domain.
   Network devices will perform the operation of IOAM data field
   encapsulation and decapsulation.

5.4.  Deployment options

   This section lists out possible deployment options that can be
   employed to meet the requirements listed in Section 5.1.

5.4.1.  IP-in-IPv6 encapsulation with ULA

   The "IP-in-IPv6 encapsulation with ULA" [RFC4193] approach can be
   used to apply IOAM to either an IPv6 or an IPv4 network.  In
   addition, it fulfills requirement C4 (avoid leaks) by using ULA for
   the IOAM Overlay Network.  The original IP packet is preserved.  An
   IPv6 header including IOAM data fields in an extension header is
   added in front of it, to forward traffic within and across the IOAM
   domain.  IPv6 addresses for the IOAM Overlay Network, i.e. the outer
   IPv6 addresses are assigned from the ULA space.  Addressing and
   routing in the IOAM Overlay Network are to be configured so that the
   IP-in-IPv6 encapsulated packets follow the same path as the original,
   non-encapsulated packet would have taken.  This would create an
   internal IPv6 forwarding topology using the IOAM domain's interior
   ULA address space which is parallel with the forwarding topology that
   exists with the non-IOAM address space (the topology and address
   space that would be followed by packets that do not have supplemental
   IOAM information).  Establishment and maintenance of the parallel
   IOAM ULA forwarding topology could be automated, e.g., similar to how
   LDP [RFC5036] is used in MPLS to establish and maintain an LSP
   forwarding topology that is parallel to the network's IGP forwarding
   topology.

   Transit across the IOAM Overlay Network could leverage the transit
   approach for traffic between BGP border routers, as described in
   [RFC1772], "A.2.3 Encapsulation".  Assuming that the operational
   guidelines specified in Section 4 of [RFC4193] are properly followed,
   the probability of leaks in this approach will be almost close to
   zero.  If the packets do leak through IOAM egress device
   misconfiguration or partial IOAM egress device failure, the packets'
   ULA destination address is invalid outside of the IOAM domain.  There
   is no exterior destination to be reached, and the packets will be
   dropped when they encounter either a router external to the IOAM
   domain that has a packet filter that drops packets with ULA
   destinations, or a router that does not have a default route.

5.4.2.  x-in-IPv6 Encapsulation that is used Independently

   In some cases it is desirable to monitor a domain that uses an
   overlay network that is deployed independently of the need for IOAM,
   e.g., an overlay network that runs Geneve-in-IPv6, or VXLAN-in-IPv6.
   In this case IOAM can be encapsulated in as an extension header in
   the tunnel (outer) IPv6 header.  Thus, the tunnel encapsulating node
   is also the IOAM encapsulating node, and the tunnel end point is also
   the IOAM decapsulating node.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document describes the encapsulation of IOAM data fields in
   IPv6.  Security considerations of the specific IOAM data fields for
   each case (i.e., Trace, Proof of Transit, and E2E) are described and
   defined in [RFC9197].

   As this document describes new options for IPv6, these are similar to
   the security considerations of [RFC8200] and the weakness documented
   in [RFC8250].

7.  IANA Considerations

   This draft requests the following IPv6 Option Type assignments from
   the Destination Options and Hop-by-Hop Options sub-registry of
   Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) Parameters.
