1.  Introduction

   "In-situ" Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM) records
   OAM information within the packet while the packet traverses a
   particular network domain.  The term "in-situ" refers to the fact
   that the OAM data is added to the data packets rather than being sent
   within packets specifically dedicated to OAM.  IOAM is to complement
   mechanisms such as Ping or Traceroute.  In terms of "active" or
   "passive" OAM, "in-situ" OAM can be considered a hybrid OAM type.
   "In-situ" mechanisms do not require extra packets to be sent.  IOAM
   adds information to the already available data packets and therefore
   cannot be considered passive.  In terms of the classification given

Internet-Draft         IOAM-Data-Fields Integrity              July 2022


   in [RFC7799], IOAM could be portrayed as Hybrid Type I.  IOAM
   mechanisms can be leveraged where mechanisms using, e.g., ICMP do not
   apply or do not offer the desired results, such as proving that a
   certain traffic flow takes a pre-defined path, SLA verification for
   the data traffic, detailed statistics on traffic distribution paths
   in networks that distribute traffic across multiple paths, or
   scenarios in which probe traffic is potentially handled differently
   from regular data traffic by the network devices.

   [RFC9197] assumes that IOAM is deployed in limited domains, where an
   operator has means to select, monitor, and control the access to all
   the networking devices, making the domain a trusted network.  As
   such, IOAM-Data-Fields are carried in clear within packets and there
   are no protections against any node or middlebox tampering with the
   data.  IOAM-Data-Fields collected in an untrusted or semi-trusted
   environment require integrity protection to support critical
   operational decisions.

   The following considerations and requirements are to be taken into
   account in addition to addressing the problem of detectability of any
   integrity breach of the IOAM-Data-Fields collected:

   1.  IOAM data is processed by the data plane, hence viability of any
       method to prove integrity of the IOAM-Data-Fields must be
       feasible at data plane processing/forwarding rates (IOAM might be
       applied to all traffic a router forwards).

   2.  IOAM data is carried within packets.  Additional space required
       to prove integrity of the IOAM-Data-Fields needs to be optimal,
       i.e.  should not exceed the MTU or have adverse effect on packet
       processing.

   3.  Replay protection of older IOAM data should be possible.  Without
       replay protection, a rogue node can present the old IOAM data,
       masking any ongoing network issues/activity and making the IOAM-
       Data-Fields collection useless.

   This document defines the methods to protect the integrity of IOAM-
   Data-Fields, using the IOAM Option-Types specified in [RFC9197] as an
   example.  The methods similarly apply to other IOAM Option-Types
   which contain IOAM-Data-Fields.

3.  Threat Analysis

   This section presents a threat analysis of integrity-related threats
   in the context of IOAM.  The threats that are discussed are assumed
   to be independent of the lower layer protocols; it is assumed that
   threats at other layers are handled by security mechanisms that are
   deployed at these layers.

   This document is focused on integrity protection for IOAM-Data-
   Fields.  Thus the threat analysis includes threats that are related
   to or result from compromising the integrity of IOAM-Data-Fields.
   Other security aspects such as confidentiality are not within the
   scope of this document.

   Throughout the analysis there is a distinction between on-path and
   off-path attackers.  As discussed in [RFC9055], on-path attackers are
   located in a position that allows interception and modification of
   in-flight protocol packets, whereas off-path attackers can only
   attack by generating protocol packets.

   The analysis also includes the impact of each of the threats.
   Generally speaking, the impact of a successful attack on an OAM
   protocol [RFC7276] is a false illusion of nonexistent failures or
   preventing the detection of actual ones; in both cases, the attack
   may result in denial of service (DoS).  Furthermore, creating the
   false illusion of a nonexistent issue may trigger unnecessary
   processing in some of the IOAM nodes along the path, and may cause
   more IOAM-related data to be exported to the management plane than is
   conventionally necessary.  Beyond these general impacts, threat-
   specific impacts are discussed in each of the subsections below.

3.1.  Modification: IOAM-Data-Fields

   Threat





Brockners, et al.        Expires January 6, 2023                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft         IOAM-Data-Fields Integrity              July 2022


      An attacker can maliciously modify the IOAM-Data-Fields of in-
      transit packets.  The modification can either be applied to all
      packets or selectively applied to a subset of the en route
      packets.  This threat is applicable to on-path attackers.

   Impact

      By systematically modifying the IOAM-Data-Fields of some or all of
      the in-transit packets, an attacker can create a false picture of
      the paths in the network, the existence of faulty nodes and their
      location, and the network performance.

3.2.  Modification: IOAM Option-Type Headers

   Threat

      An on-path attacker can modify the header in IOAM Option-Types in
      order to change or disrupt the behavior of nodes processing IOAM-
      Data-Fields along the path.  This threat is not within the scope
      of this document.

   Impact

      Changing the header of IOAM Option-Types may have several
      implications.  An attacker can maliciously increase the processing
      overhead in nodes that process IOAM-Data-Fields and increase the
      on-the-wire overhead of IOAM-Data-Fields, for example by modifying
      the IOAM-Trace-Type field in the IOAM Trace Option-Type header.
      An attacker can also prevent some of the nodes that process IOAM-
      Data-Fields from incorporating IOAM-Data-Fields, by modifying the
      RemainingLen field in the IOAM Trace Option-Type header.

3.3.  Injection: IOAM-Data-Fields

   Threat

      An attacker can inject packets with IOAM Option-Types and IOAM-
      Data-Fields.  This threat is applicable to both on-path and off-
      path attackers.

   Impact

      This attack and its impacts are similar to Section 3.1.

Internet-Draft         IOAM-Data-Fields Integrity              July 2022


3.4.  Injection: IOAM Option-Type Headers

   Threat

      An attacker can inject packets with IOAM Option-Type headers, thus
      manipulating other nodes that process IOAM-Data-Fields in the
      network.  This threat is applicable to both on-path and off-path
      attackers.  This threat is not within the scope of this document.

   Impact

      This attack and its impacts are similar to Section 3.2.

3.5.  Management and Exporting

   Threat

      Attacks that compromise the integrity of IOAM-Data-Fields can be
      applied at the management plane, e.g., by manipulating network
      management packets.  Furthermore, the integrity of IOAM-Data-
      Fields that are exported to a receiving entity can also be
      compromised.  Management plane attacks are not within the scope of
      this document; the network management protocol is expected to
      include inherent security capabilities.  The integrity of exported
      data is also not within the scope of this document.  It is
      expected that the specification of the export format will discuss
      the relevant security aspects.

   Impact

      Malicious manipulation of the management protocol can cause nodes
      that process IOAM-Data-Fields to malfunction, to be overloaded, or
      to incorporate unnecessary IOAM-Data-Fields into user packets.
      The impact of compromising the integrity of exported IOAM-Data-
      Fields is similar to the impacts of previous threats that were
      described in this section.

3.6.  Delay

   Threat

      An on-path attacker may delay some or all of the in-transit
      packets that include IOAM-Data-Fields in order to create the false
      illusion of congestion.  Delay attacks are well known in the
      context of deterministic networks [RFC9055] and synchronization
      [RFC7384], and may be somewhat mitigated in these environments by
      using redundant paths in a way that is resilient to an attack
      along one of the paths.  This approach does not address the threat



Brockners, et al.        Expires January 6, 2023                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft         IOAM-Data-Fields Integrity              July 2022


      in the context of IOAM, as it does not meet the requirement to
      measure a specific path or to detect a problem along the path.  It
      is noted that this threat is not within the scope of the threats
      that are mitigated in this document.

   Impact

      Since IOAM can be applied to a fraction of the traffic, an
      attacker can detect and delay only the packets that include IOAM-
      Data-Fields, thus preventing the authenticity of delay and load
      measurements.

4.  Integrity Protected Option-Types

   This section defines new IOAM Option-Types to be allocated in the
   IOAM Option-Type Registry.  Their purpose is to carry IOAM-Data-
   Fields with integrity protection.  Each of the IOAM Option-Types
   defined in [RFC9197] is extended as follows:

   64 IOAM Pre-allocated Trace Integrity Protected Option-Type:
      corresponds to the IOAM Pre-allocated Trace Option-Type with
      integrity protection.

   65 IOAM Incremental Trace Integrity Protected Option-Type:
      corresponds to the IOAM Incremental Trace Option-Type with
      integrity protection.

   66 IOAM POT Integrity Protected Option-Type: corresponds to the IOAM
      POT Option-Type with integrity protection.

   67 IOAM E2E Integrity Protected Option-Type: corresponds to the IOAM
      E2E Option-Type with integrity protection.

   The Integrity Protection subheader follows the IOAM Option-Type
   header when the IOAM Option-Type is an Integrity Protected Option-
   Type.  It is defined as follows:


    0                   1                   2                   3

   Signature-suite:  8-bit unsigned integer.  This field defines the
      algorithms used to compute the digest and the signature over the
      IOAM-Data-Fields.

   Nonce length:  8-bit unsigned integer.  This field specifies the
      length of the Nonce in octets.

      transmission and ignored upon receipt.

   Nonce:  Variable length field with length specified in Nonce length.

   Signature:  Digital signature value generated by the method and
      algorithm specified by Signature-suite.

4.1.  Integrity Protected Trace Option-Types

   Both the IOAM Pre-allocated Trace Option-Type header and the IOAM
   Incremental Trace Option-Type header, as defined in [RFC9197], are
   followed by the Integrity Protection subheader when the IOAM Option-
   Type is respectively set to the IOAM Pre-allocated Trace Integrity
   Protected Option-Type or the IOAM Incremental Trace Integrity
   Protected Option-Type:

5.  Methods for space optimized integrity protection

   Methods for space optimized integrity protection can leverage
   symmetric or asymmetric key based signatures, as described in the
   subsections below.  The Signature consumes 32 octets and is carried
   only once for the entire packet.  In case of performance concerns,
   such method can be applied to a subset of the traffic by using
   sampling of data to enable IOAM with integrity protection.  Both
   symmetric and asymmetric signature methods work similarly, as
   follows:

   1.  The encapsulating node creates a nonce and stores it in the Nonce
       field of the Integrity Protection subheader.  The signature is
       generated over the Nonce field and the hash of IOAM-Data-Fields
       it has inserted, i.e., sign(Nonce || hash(IOAM-Data-Fields)).
       IOAM-Data-Fields supposed to be modified by other IOAM nodes on
       the path MUST be excluded from the signature (e.g., the POT
       Cumulative field).  The signature is stored in the Signature
       field of the Integrity Protection subheader.  Important note: if
       all the inserted IOAM-Data-Fields are supposed to be modified by
       other IOAM nodes on the path, or if there is no IOAM-Data-Field
       inserted at all, then the encapsulating node MUST NOT use an
       Integrity Protected Option-Type.

   2.  A transit node generates a signature over the Signature field and
       the hash of IOAM-Data-Fields it has inserted, i.e.,
       sign(Signature || hash(IOAM-Data-Fields)).  IOAM-Data-Fields
       modified in-place by the transit node MUST be excluded from the
       signature (e.g., the POT Cumulative field).  The signature is
       stored in the Signature field of the Integrity Protection
       subheader.  Important note: if the transit node does not insert
       IOAM-Data-Fields (e.g., it only modifies IOAM-Data-Fields in-
       place, or does nothing), then the transit node MUST NOT generate
       a signature and MUST NOT update the Signature field.

   3.  The decapsulating node (aka the Validator) is responsible for the
       integrity verification of the IOAM-Data-Fields collected.
       Serving as the Validator, the decapsulating node MUST NOT
       generate a signature based on IOAM-Data-Fields it has inserted,
       if any, and therefore MUST NOT update the Signature field.  To
       validate the IOAM-Data-Fields integrity, the Validator recomputes
       the signature by iteratively following the same procedure as for
       the encapsulating and transit nodes, in that order, using their
       respective keys (see Section 5.1 or Section 5.2 depending on the
       approach, i.e., symmetric or asymmetric).  The recomputed
       signature is then compared to the Signature field.  It is trivial
       in some cases (e.g., with POT Type-0 or E2E Option-Types), where
       only the encapsulating node generates a signature, as specified
       by the method described in this section.  For other cases where
       transit nodes also generate a signature (e.g., with Trace Option-
       Types), node-ids MUST be included in IOAM-Data-Fields.  Details
       on how the mapping between node-ids and keys is implemented on
       the Validator are outside the scope of this document.

5.1.  Symmetric key based signature

   This method assumes that symmetric keys have been distributed to the
   respective nodes as well as the Validator (the Validator receives all
   the keys).  The details of the mechanisms responsible for key
   distribution are outside the scope of this document.

   This method MUST use an algorithm pair defined in Section 6.2 and the
   approach MUST be symmetric.

5.2.  Asymmetric key based signature

   This method assumes that asymmetric keys have been generated per IOAM
   node and the respective nodes can access their keys (the Validator
   receives all the public keys).  The details of the mechanisms
   responsible for key distribution are outside the scope of this
   document.

   This method MUST use an algorithm pair defined in Section 6.2 and the
   approach MUST be asymmetric.

6.2.  IOAM Integrity Protection Algorithm Suite Registry

   "IOAM Integrity Protection Algorithm Suite Registry" in the "In-Situ
   OAM (IOAM) Protocol Parameters" group.  The one-octet "IOAM Integrity
   Protection Algorithm Suite Registry" identifiers assigned by IANA
   identify the digest algorithm and signature algorithm used in the
   Signature Suite Identifier field.  IANA has registered the following
   algorithm suite identifiers for the digest algorithm and for the
   signature algorithm.

            IOAM Integrity Protection Algorithm Suite Registry

   Future assignments are to be made using the Standards Action process
   defined in [RFC8126].  Assignments consist of the one-octet algorithm
   suite identifier value and the associated digest algorithm name and
   signature algorithm name.

7.1.  Replay protection

   The nonce makes a signature chain unique but does not necessarily
   prevent replay attacks.  To enable replay protection, the
   encapsulating node and the Validator MUST use a common, unique nonce.
