 Abstract
 
|   In-situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) records
    operational and telemetry information in the packet while the packet
|   traverses a path between two points in the network.  In-situ OAM is
    to complement current out-of-band OAM mechanisms based on ICMP or
|   other types of probe packets.  This document outlines how in-situ OAM
    data records can be transported in protocols such as NSH, Segment
|   Routing, VXLAN-GPE, native IPv6 (via extension headers), and IPv4.
    Transport options are currently investigated as part of an
    implementation study.  This document is intended to only serve
    informational purposes.

 1.  Introduction
 
|   This document discusses transport mechanisms for "in-situ"
|   Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) data records.  In-
|   situ OAM records OAM information within the packet while the packet
|   traverses a particular network domain.  The term "in-situ" refers to
|   the fact that the OAM data is added to the data packets rather than
|   is being sent within packets specifically dedicated to OAM.  A
|   discussion of the motivation and requirements for in-situ OAM can be
|   found in [I-D.brockners-inband-oam-requirements].  Data types and
|   data formats for in-situ OAM are defined in
|   [I-D.brockners-inband-oam-data].
 
|   This document outlines transport encapsulations for the in-situ OAM
|   data defined in [I-D.brockners-inband-oam-data].  This document is to
|   serve informational purposes only.  As part of an in-situ OAM
|   implementation study different protocol encapsulations for in-situ
    OAM data are being explored.  Once data formats and encapsulation
|   approaches are settled, protocol specific specifications for in-situ
    OAM data transport will address the standardization aspect.
 
|   The data for in-situ OAM defined in [I-D.brockners-inband-oam-data]
    can be carried in a variety of protocols based on the deployment
|   needs.  This document discusses transport of in-situ OAM data for the
    following protocols:
 
    o  IPv6
 
|   o  IPv4
|
    o  VXLAN-GPE
 
    o  NSH
 
    o  Segment Routing (IPv6 and MPLS)
 
|   This list is non-exhaustive, as it is possible to carry the in-situ
    OAM data in several other protocols and transports.
 
|   A feasibility study of in-situ OAM is currently underway as part of
|   the FD.io project [FD.io].  The in-situ OAM implementation study
|   should be considered as a "tool box" to showcase how "in-situ" OAM
    can complement probe-packet based OAM mechanisms for different
    deployments and packet transport formats.  For details, see the open
    source code in the FD.io [FD.io].

 3.  In-Band OAM Metadata Transport in IPv6
 
|   This mechanisms of in-situ OAM in IPv6 complement others proposed to
    enhance diagnostics of IPv6 networks, such as the IPv6 Performance
    and Diagnostic Metrics Destination Option described in
    [I-D.ietf-ippm-6man-pdm-option].  The IP Performance and Diagnostic
    Metrics Destination Option is destination focused and specific to
|   IPv6, whereas in-situ OAM is performed between end-points of the
    network or a network domain where it is enabled and used.
 
    A historical note: The idea of IPv6 route recording was originally
|   introduced by [I-D.kitamura-ipv6-record-route] back in year 2000.
    With IPv6 now being generally deployed and new concepts such as
    Segment Routing [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing] being introduced,
|   it is imperative to further mature the Operations, Administration,
|   and Maintenance mechanisms available to IPv6 networks.
 
|   The in-situ OAM options translate into options for an IPv6 extension
    header.  The extension header would be inserted by either a host
|   source of the packet, or by a transit/domain-edge node.  If the
|   addition of the in-situ OAM Hop-by-Hop Option header would lead to
|   the packet exceeding the MTU of the domain an error should be
|   reported.  The methods and procedures of how the error is reported
|   are outside the scope of this document.  Likewise if an ICMPv6
|   forwarding error occurs between encapsulating and decapsulating
|   nodes, the node generating the ICMPv6 error should strip the in-situ
|   OAM Hop-by-Hop Option header before sending the ICMPv6 message to the
|   source.
 
|3.1.  In-situ OAM in IPv6 Hop by Hop Extension Header
 
|   This section defines in-situ OAM for IPv6 transport.  In-situ OAM
    data is transported as an IPv6 hop-by-hop extension header.
 
|3.1.1.  In-situ OAM Hop by Hop Options
 
    Brief recap of the IPv6 hop-by-hop header as well as the options used
|   for carrying in-situ OAM data:
 
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |  Next Header  |  Hdr Ext Len  |                               |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+                               +
     |                                                               |
     .                                                               .
     .                            Options                            .
     .                                                               .
     |                                                               |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
 
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+- - - - - - - - -
       |  Option Type  |  Opt Data Len |  Option Data
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+- - - - - - - - -
 
    With 2 highest order bits of Option Type indicating the following:
 
       00 - skip over this option and continue processing the header.
 
       01 - discard the packet.
 
       10 - discard the packet and, regardless of whether or not the
            packet's Destination Address was a multicast address, send an
            ICMP Parameter Problem, Code 2, message to the packet's
            Source Address, pointing to the unrecognized Option Type.
 
       11 - discard the packet and, only if the packet's Destination
            Address was not a multicast address, send an ICMP Parameter
            Problem, Code 2, message to the packet's Source Address,
            pointing to the unrecognized Option Type.
 
    3rd highest bit:
 
       0 - Option Data does not change en-route
 
       1 - Option Data may change en-route
 
|   In-situ OAM data records are inserted as options in an IPv6 hop-by-
    hop extension header:
 
|   1.  Tracing Option: The in-situ OAM Tracing option defined in
|       [I-D.brockners-inband-oam-data] is represented as a IPv6 option
        in hop by hop extension header by allocating following type:
 
        Option Type:  001xxxxxx 8-bit identifier of the type of option.
           xxxxxx=TBD_IANA_TRACE_OPTION_IPV6.
 
|   2.  Proof of Transit Option: The in-situ OAM POT option defined in
|       [I-D.brockners-inband-oam-data] is represented as a IPv6 option
        in hop by hop extension header by allocating following type:
 
        Option Type:  001xxxxxx 8-bit identifier of the type of option.
           xxxxxx=TBD_IANA_POT_OPTION_IPV6.
 
|   3.  Edge to Edge Option: The in-situ OAM E2E option defined in
|       [I-D.brockners-inband-oam-data] is represented as a IPv6 option
        in hop by hop extension header by allocating following type:
 
        Option Type:  000xxxxxx 8-bit identifier of the type of option.
           xxxxxx=TBD_IANA_E2E_OPTION_IPV6.
 
|3.1.2.  Procedure at the Ingress Edge to Insert the In-situ OAM Header
 
|   In an administrative domain where in-situ OAM is used, insertion of
|   the in-situ OAM header is enabled at the required edge nodes (i.e. at
|   the encapsulating/decapsulating nodes) by means of configuration.
 
|   Such a configuration SHOULD allow selective enablement of in-situ OAM
|   header insertion for a subset of traffic (e.g., one or several
|   "pipes").
 
    Further the ingress edge node should be aware of maximum size of the
    header that can be inserted.  Details on how the maximum size/size of
|   the in-situ OAM domain are retrieved are outside the scope of this
    document.
 
|   Let n = max number of nodes updating in-situ OAM data;
|   (calculated based on the packet size and the minimal MTU on all
|   links within the OAM domain)
 
|   Let k = number of node data records that can be allocated
|   by this node.
 
|   Let node_data_size = size of each node_data based on
|   in-situ OAM type.
|
|   if (packet matches traffic for which in-situ OAM is enabled) {
|       Create in-situ OAM hbyh ext-header with k node data records
|       preallocated.
        Increment payload length in IPv6 header :
|                         with size of in-situ OAM hbyh ext-header
        Populate node data at :
|          (size of in-situ OAM hbyh ext-header = 8) + k * node_data_size
        from the beginning of the header
|       Set Elements-left to: k - 1
 
|       Update "Next Header" field in main IPv6 header and
|       set "Next Header" field of OAM hbyh extension header
|       appropriately.
     }
 
|3.1.3.  Procedure at Transit Nodes
 
|   If a network node receives a packet with an in-situ OAM header and it
|   is enabled to process in-situ OAM data it performs the following:
 
    k = number of node data that this node can allocate
|
|   if (in-situ OAM ext hbyh ext-header is present) {
|       if (Elements-left > 0)) {
          populate node data at :
|            node_data_start[Elements-left]
|         Elements-left = Elements-left - 1
        }
    }
 
|3.1.4.  Procedure at the Egress Edge to Remove the In-situ OAM Header
|   egress_edge = list of interfaces where in-situ OAM hbyh ext
                   header is to be stripped
|
    Before forwarding packet out of interfaces in egress_edge list:
|
|   if (in-situ OAM hbyh ext-header is present) {
|      remove the in-situ OAM hbyh ext-header,
       possibly store the record along with additional
       fields for analysis and export
       Decrement Payload Length in IPv6 header
|      by size of in-situ OAM ext header
|
|      Update "Next Header" field in main IPv6 header and
|      set "Next Header" field of OAM hbyh extension header
|      appropriately.
    }
 
|4.  In-situ OAM Metadata Transport in IPv4
|
|   Transport of in-situ OAM data in IPv4 will be detailed in a future
|   version of this document.
|
|5.  In-situ OAM Metadata Transport in VXLAN-GPE
 
    VXLAN-GPE [I-D.ietf-nvo3-vxlan-gpe] encapsulation is somewhat similar
    to IPv6 extension headers in that a series of headers can be
|   contained in the header as a linked list.  The different in-situ OAM
|   types are added as options within a new in-situ OAM protocol header
|   in VXLAN GPE.  In an administrative domain where in-situ OAM is used,
|   insertion of the in-situ OAM protocol header in VXLAN GPE is enabled
|   at the VXLAN GPE tunnel endpoint which also serve as in-situ OAM
|   encapsulating/decapsulating nodes by means of configuration.
 
|   In-situ OAM header in VXLAN GPE header:
 
     0                   1                   2                   3

    The VXLAN-GPE header and fields are defined in
|   [I-D.ietf-nvo3-vxlan-gpe]. in-situ OAM specific fields and header are
    defined here:
 
|   Type:  8-bit unsigned integer defining in-situ OAM header type
 
|   in-situ OAM HDR len:  8-bit unsigned integer.  Length of the in-situ
       OAM HDR in 8-octet units
 
|   in-situ OAM options:  Variable-length field, of length such that the
|      complete in-situ OAM header is an integer multiple of 8 octets
       long.  Contains one or more TLV-encoded options of the format:
 
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+- - - - - - - - -
    |  Option Type  |  Opt Data Len |  Option Data
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+- - - - - - - - -
 
       Option Type          8-bit identifier of the type of option.
 
       Opt Data Len         8-bit unsigned integer.  Length of the Option
                            Data field of this option, in octets.
 
       Option Data          Variable-length field.  Option-Type-specific
                            data.
 
|   The in-situ OAM options defined in [I-D.brockners-inband-oam-data]
|   are encoded with an option type allocated in the new in-situ OAM IANA
|   registry - in-situ OAM_PROTOCOL_OPTION_REGISTRY_IANA_TBD.  In
    addition the following padding options are defined to be used when
    necessary to align subsequent options and to pad out the containing
    header to a multiple of 8 octets in length.
 
    Pad1 option  (alignment requirement: none)
 
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
        |       0       |
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
        NOTE: The format of the Pad1 option is a special case -- it does
              not have length and value fields.
 
        The Pad1 option is used to insert one octet of padding into the
        Options area of a header.  If more than one octet of padding is
        required, the PadN option, described next, should be used, rather
        than multiple Pad1 options.
 
    PadN option  (alignment requirement: none)
 
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+- - - - - - - - -
        |       1       |  Opt Data Len |  Option Data
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+- - - - - - - - -
        The PadN option is used to insert two or more octets of padding
        into the Options area of a header.  For N octets of padding, the
        Opt Data Len field contains the value N-2, and the Option Data
        consists of N-2 zero-valued octets.
 
|6.  In-situ OAM Metadata Transport in NSH
 
    In Service Function Chaining (SFC) [RFC7665], the Network Service
    Header (NSH) [I-D.ietf-sfc-nsh] already includes path tracing
    capabilities [I-D.penno-sfc-trace], but currently does not offer a
    solution to securely prove that packets really traversed the service
    chain.  The "Proof of Transit" capabilities (see
|   [I-D.brockners-inband-oam-requirements] and
|   [I-D.brockners-proof-of-transit]) of in-situ OAM can be leveraged
|   within NSH.  In an administrative domain where in-situ OAM is used,
|   insertion of the in-situ OAM data into the NSH header is enabled at
|   the required nodes (i.e. at the in-situ OAM encapsulating/
|   decapsulating nodes) by means of configuration.
|
|   Proof of transit in-situ OAM data is added as NSH Type 2 metadata:

    TLV Class:  Describes the scope of the "Type" field.  In some cases,
       the TLV Class will identify a specific vendor, in others, the TLV
       Class will identify specific standards body allocated types.  POT
       is currently defined using the Cisco (0x0009) TLV class.
 
    Type:  The specific type of information being carried, within the
       scope of a given TLV Class.  Value allocation is the
       responsibility of the TLV Class owner.  Currently a type value of
       0x94 is used for proof of transit
 
    Reserved bits:  Two reserved bit are present for future use.  The
       reserved bits MUST be set to 0x0.
 
    F: One bit.  Indicates which POT-profile is active. 0 means the even
       POT-profile is active, 1 means the odd POT-profile is active.
 
    Length:  Length of the variable metadata, in 4-octet words.  Here the
       length is 4.
 
|   Random:  64-bit Per-packet Random number.
 
    Cumulative:  64-bit Cumulative that is updated by the Service
       Functions.
 
|7.  In-situ OAM Metadata Transport in Segment Routing
 
|7.1.  In-situ OAM in SR with IPv6 Transport
 
    Similar to NSH, a service chain or path defined using Segment Routing
|   for IPv6 can be verified using the in-situ OAM "Proof of Transit"
    approach.  The Segment Routing Header (SRH) for IPv6 offers the
    ability to transport TLV structured data, similar to what NSH does
|   (see [I-D.ietf-6man-segment-routing-header]).  In an domain where in-
|   situ OAM is used, insertion of the in-situ OAM data is enabled at the
|   required edge nodes (i.e. at the in-situ OAM encapsulating/
|   decapsulating nodes) by means of configuration.
|
|   A new "POT TLV" is defined for the SRH which is to carry proof of
|   transit in situ OAM data.

    RESERVED:  8 bits.  SHOULD be unset on transmission and MUST be
       ignored on receipt.
 
    F: 1 bit.  Indicates which POT-profile is active. 0 means the even
       POT-profile is active, 1 means the odd POT-profile is active.
 
    Flags:  8 bits.  No flags are defined in this document.
 
|   Random:  64-bit per-packet random number.
 
    Cumulative:  64-bit cumulative value that is updated at specific
       nodes that form the service path to be verified.
 
|7.2.  In-situ OAM in SR with MPLS Transport
 
|   In-situ OAM "Proof of Transit" data can also be carried as part of
    the MPLS label stack.  Details will be addressed in a future version
    of this document.
