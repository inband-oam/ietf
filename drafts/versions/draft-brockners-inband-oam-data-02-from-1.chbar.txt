 Abstract
 
    In-band operation, administration and maintenance (OAM) records
    operational and telemetry information in the packet while the packet
    traverses a path between two points in the network.  This document
    discusses the data types and data formats for in-band OAM data
    records.  In-band OAM data records can be embedded into a variety of
    transports such as NSH, Segment Routing, VXLAN-GPE, native IPv6 (via
    extension header), or IPv4.  In-band OAM is to complement current
    out-of-band OAM mechanisms based on ICMP or other types of probe
    packets.

 1.  Introduction
 
    This document defines data record types for "in-band" operation,
    administration, and maintenance (OAM).  In-band OAM records OAM
    information within the packet while the packet traverses a particular
    network domain.  The term "in-band" refers to the fact that the OAM
    data is added to the data packets rather than is being sent within
    packets specifically dedicated to OAM.  A discussion of the
    motivation and requirements for in-band OAM can be found in
|   [I-D.brockners-inband-oam-requirements].  In-band OAM is to
    complement "out-of-band" or "active" mechanisms such as ping or
    traceroute, or more recent active probing mechanisms as described in
    [I-D.lapukhov-dataplane-probe].  In-band OAM mechanisms can be
    leveraged where current out-of-band mechanisms do not apply or do not
    offer the desired results, such as proving that a certain set of
    traffic takes a pre-defined path, SLA verification for the live data
    traffic, detailed statistics on traffic distribution paths in
    networks that distribute traffic across multiple paths, or scenarios
    where probe traffic is potentially handled differently from regular
    data traffic by the network devices.
 
    This document defines the data types and data formats for in-band OAM
    data records.  The in-band OAM data records can be transported by a
    variety of transport protocols, including NSH, Segment Routing,
    VXLAN-GPE, IPv6, IPv4.  Encapsulation details for these different
    transport protocols are outside the scope of this document.

 3.  In-band OAM Data Types and Data Format
 
    This section defines in-band OAM data types and data formats of the
    data records required for in-band OAM.  The different uses of in-band
    OAM require the definition of different types of data.  The in-band
    OAM data format for the data being carried corresponds to the three
    main categories of in-band OAM data defined in
|   [I-D.brockners-inband-oam-requirements], which are edge-to-edge, per
|   node, and for selected nodes only.
 
    Transport options for in-band OAM data are found in
|   [I-D.brockners-inband-oam-transport].  In-band OAM data is defined as
|   options in Type-Length-Value (TLV) format.  The TLV format for each
|   of the three different types of in-band OAM data is defined in this
|   document.
 
    In-band OAM is expected to be deployed in a specific domain rather
    than on the overall Internet.  The part of the network which employs
    in-band OAM is referred to as "in-band OAM-domain".  In-band OAM data
    is added to a packet on entering the in-band OAM-domain and is
    removed from the packet when exiting the domain.  Within the in-band
    OAM-domain, the in-band OAM data may be updated by network nodes that
    the packet traverses.  The device which adds in-band OAM data to the
    packet is called the "in-band OAM encapsulating node", whereas the
    device which removed the in-band OAM data is referred to as the "in-
    band OAM decapsulating node".  Nodes within the domain which are
    aware of in-band OAM data and read and/or write or process the in-
    band OAM data are called "in-band OAM transit nodes".  Note that not
    every node in an in-band OAM domain needs to be an in-band OAM
    transit node.  For example, a Segment Routing deployment might
    require the segment routing path to be verified.  In that case, only
    the SR nodes would also be in-band OAM transit nodes rather than all
    nodes.
 
 3.1.  In-band OAM Tracing Option
 
    "In-band OAM tracing data" is expected to be collected at every hop
    that a packet traverses, i.e., in a typical deployment all nodes in
    an in-band OAM-domain would participate in in-band OAM and thus be
    in-band OAM transit nodes, in-band OAM encapsulating or in-band OAM
    decapsulating nodes.  The network diameter of the in-band OAM domain
    is assumed to be known.  For in-band OAM tracing, the in-band OAM
    encapsulating node allocates an array which is to store operational
    data retrieved from every node while the packet traverses the domain.
    Every entry is to hold information for a particular in-band OAM
    transit node that is traversed by a packet.  In-band OAM transit
    nodes update the content of the array.  A pointer which is part of
    the in-band OAM trace data points to the next empty slot in the
    array, which is where the next in-band OAM transit node fills in its
    data.  The in-band OAM decapsulating node removes the in-band OAM
    data and process and/or export the metadata.  In-band OAM data uses
    its own name-space for information such as node identifier or
    interface identifier.  This allows for a domain-specific definition
    and interpretation.  For example: In one case an interface-id could
    point to a physical interface (e.g., to understand which physical
    interface of an aggregated link is used when receiving or
    transmitting a packet) whereas in another case it could refer to a
    logical interface (e.g., in case of tunnels).
 
    The following in-band OAM data is defined for in-band OAM tracing:
 
    o  Identification of the in-band OAM node.  An in-band OAM node
       identifier can match to a device identifier or a particular
       control point or subsystem within a device.
 
    o  Identification of the interface that a packet was received on.
 
    o  Identification of the interface that a packet was sent out on.
 
    o  Time of day when the packet was processed by the node.  Different
       definitions of processing time are feasible and expected, though
       it is important that all devices of an in-band OAM domain follow
       the same definition.
 
    o  Generic data: Format-free information where syntax and semantic of
       the information is defined by the operator in a specific
       deployment.  For a specific deployment, all in-band OAM nodes
       should interpret the generic data the same way.  Examples for
       generic in-band OAM data include geo-location information
       (location of the node at the time the packet was processed),
       buffer queue fill level or cache fill level at the time the packet
       was processed, or even a battery charge level.
 
    o  A mechanism to detect whether in-band OAM trace data was added at
       every hop or whether certain hops in the domain weren't in-band
       OAM transit nodes.
 
    The "Node data List" array in the packet is populated iteratively as
    the packet traverses the network, starting with the last entry of the
    array, i.e., "Node data List [n]" is the first entry to be populated,
    "Node data List [n-1]" is the second one, etc.

    Option Type:  8-bit identifier of the type of option.  Option number
       is defined based on the encapsulation protocol.

       field of this option, in octets.
 
    OAM-trace-type:  8-bit identifier of a particular trace element
       variant.
 
       The trace type value can be interpreted as a bit field.  The
       following bit fields are defined in this document, with details on
       each field described in the next section.  The order of packing
       the trace data in each Node-data element follows the bit order for
       setting each trace data element.  Only a valid combination of
       these fields defined in this document are valid in-band OAM-trace-
       types.

       Bit 5-7  Undefined in this document.
 
       Section 3.1.1 describes the format of a number of trace types.
       Specifically, it exemplifies OAM-trace-types 0x00011111,
       0x00000111, 0x00001001, 0x00010001, and 0x00011001.
 
    Elements-left:  8-bit unsigned integer.  A pointer that indicates the
       next data recording point in the data space of the packet in
       octets.  It is the index into the "Node data List" array shown
       above.
 
    Node data List [n]:  Variable-length field.  The format of which is
       determined by the OAM Type representing the n-th Node data in the
       Node data List.  The Node data List is encoded starting from the
       last Node data of the path.  The first element of the node data
       list (Node data List [0]) contains the last node of the path while
       the last node data of the Node data List (Node data List[n])
       contains the first Node data of the path traced.  The index
       contained in "Elements-left" identifies the current active Node
       data to be populated.
 
 3.1.1.  In-band OAM Trace Type and Node Data Element
 
    An entry in the "Node data List" array can have different formats,
    following the needs of the a deployment.  Some deployments might only
    be interested in recording the node identifiers, whereas others might
    be interested in recording node identifier and timestamp.  The
    section defines different formats that an entry in "Node data List"
    can take.
 
    Node data has the following format:
 
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

    Trace data elements in Node data are defined as follows:
 
    Hop_Lim:  1 octet Hop limit that is set to the TTL value in the
       packet at the node that records this data.
 
    node_id:  Node identifier node_id is a 3 octet field to uniquely
       identify a node within in-band OAM domain.  The procedure to
       allocate, manage and map the node_ids is beyond the scope of this
       document.
 
    ingress_if_id:  2 octet interface identifier to record the ingress
       interface the packet was received on.
 
    egress_if_id:  2 octet interface identifier to record the egress
       interface the packet is forwarded out of.
 
    timestamp:  4 octet timestamp when packet has been processed by the
       node.
 
    app_data:  4 octet placeholder which can be used by the node to add
       application specific data.
 
    Hop Limit information is used to identify the location of the node in
    the communication path.
 
 3.2.  In-band OAM Proof of Transit Option
 
    In-band OAM Proof of Transit data is to support the path or service
    function chain [RFC7665] verification use cases.  Proof-of-transit
    uses methods like nested hashing or nested encryption of the in-band
    OAM data or mechanisms such as Shamir's Secret Sharing Schema (SSSS).
    While details on how the in-band OAM data for the proof of transit
    option is processed at in-band OAM encapsulating, decapsulating and
    transit nodes are outside the scope of the document, all of these
    approaches share the need to uniquely identify a packet as well as
    iteratively operate on a set of information that is handed from node
    to node.  Correspondingly, two pieces of information are added as in-
    band OAM data to the packet:
 
    o  Random: Unique identifier for the packet (e.g., 64-bits allow for
       the unique identification of 2^64 packets).
 
    o  Cumulative: Information which is handed from node to node and
       updated by every node according to a verification algorithm.
 
    In-band OAM Proof of Transit option:
 
     0                   1                   2                   3

    Option Type:  8-bit identifier of the type of option.
 
    Opt Data Len:  8-bit unsigned integer.  Length of the Option Data
       field of this option, in octets.
 
    POT Type:  8-bit identifier of a particular POT variant that dictates
       the POT data that is included.
 
       *  16 Octet field as described below
    Flag (F):  1-bit.  Indicates which POT-profile is active. 0 means the
       even POT-profile is active, 1 means the odd POT-profile is active.
 
    Reserved:  7-bit.  (Reserved Octet) Reserved octet for future use.
 
    Random:  64-bit Per packet Random number.
 
    Cumulative:  64-bit Cumulative that is updated at specific nodes by
       processing per packet Random number field and configured
       parameters.
 
    Note: Larger or smaller sizes of "Random" and "Cumulative" data are
    feasible and could be required for certain deployments (e.g.  in case
    of space constraints in the transport protocol used).  Future
    versions of this document will address different sizes of data for
    "proof of transit".
 
 3.3.  In-band OAM Edge-to-Edge Option
 
    The in-band OAM Edge-to-Edge Option is to carry data which is to be
    interpreted only by the in-band OAM encapsulating and in-band OAM
    decapsulating node, but not by in-band OAM transit nodes.
 
    Currently only sequence numbers use the in-band OAM Edge-to-Edge
    option.  In order to detect packet loss, packet reordering, or packet
    duplication in an in-band OAM-domain, sequence numbers can be added
    to packets of a particular tube (see
    [I-D.hildebrand-spud-prototype]).  Each tube leverages a dedicated
    namespace for its sequence numbers.
 
        0                   1                   2                   3

    Option Type:  8-bit identifier of the type of option.
 
    Opt Data Len:  8-bit unsigned integer.  Length of the Option Data
       field of this option, in octets.
 
    iOAM-E2E-Type:  8-bit identifier of a particular in-band OAM E2E
       variant.
 
          0: E2E option data is a 64-bit sequence number added to a
          specific tube which is used to identify packet loss and
          reordering for that tube.
 
    Reserved:  8-bit.  (Reserved Octet) Reserved octet for future use.
 
 4.  In-band OAM Data Export
 
    In-band OAM nodes collect information for packets traversing a domain
    that supports in-band OAM.  The device at the domain edge (which
    could also be an end-host) which receives a packet with in-band OAM
    information chooses how to process the in-band OAM data collected
    within the packet.  This decapsulating node can simply discard the
    information collected, can process the information further, or export
    the information using e.g., IPFIX.
 
    The discussion of in-band OAM data processing and export is left for
    a future version of this document.
 
 5.  IANA Considerations
