                      In-situ OAM Direct Exporting
                 draft-ietf-ippm-ioam-direct-export-08

Abstract

   In-situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM) is used
   for recording and collecting operational and telemetry information.
   Specifically, IOAM allows telemetry data to be pushed into data
   packets while they traverse the network.  This document introduces a
   new IOAM option type called the Direct Export (DEX) option, which is
   used as a trigger for IOAM data to be directly exported or locally
   aggregated without being pushed into in-flight data packets.  The
   exporting method and format are outside the scope of this document.

   network, and for incorporating IOAM data fields into in-flight data
   packets.

Internet-Draft            IOAM Direct Exporting                 May 2022


   IOAM makes use of four possible IOAM options, defined in
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data]: Pre-allocated Trace Option, Incremental
   Trace Option, Proof of Transit (POT) Option, and Edge-to-Edge Option.

   This document defines a new IOAM option type (also known as an IOAM
   type) called the Direct Export (DEX) option.  This option is used as
   a trigger for IOAM nodes to locally aggregate and process IOAM data,
   and/or to export it to a receiving entity (or entities).  Throughout
   the document this functionality is referred to as collection and/or
   exporting.  A "receiving entity" in this context can be, for example,
   an external collector, analyzer, controller, decapsulating node, or a
   software module in one of the IOAM nodes.

   Note that even though the IOAM Option-Type is called "Direct Export",
   it depends on the deployment whether the receipt of a packet with DEX
   option type leads to the creation of another packet.  Some
   deployments might simply use the packet with the DEX option type to
   trigger local processing of OAM data.  The functionality of this
   local processing is not within the scope of this document.

   This draft has evolved from combining some of the concepts of PBT-I
   from [I-D.song-ippm-postcard-based-telemetry] with immediate
   exporting from [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-flags].

3.  The Direct Exporting (DEX) IOAM Option Type

3.1.  Overview

   The DEX option is used as a trigger for collecting IOAM data locally
   or for exporting it to a receiving entity (or entities).
   Specifically, the DEX option can be used as a trigger for collecting
   IOAM data by an IOAM node and locally aggregating it; thus, this
   aggregated data can be periodically pushed to a receiving entity, or
   pulled by a receiving entity on-demand.

   This option is incorporated into data packets by an IOAM
   encapsulating node, and removed by an IOAM decapsulating node, as
   illustrated in Figure 1.  The option can be read but not modified by
   transit nodes.  Note: the terms IOAM encapsulating, decapsulating and
   transit nodes are as defined in [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].

                        Figure 1: DEX Architecture

   The DEX option is used as a trigger to collect and/or export IOAM
   data.  The trigger applies to transit nodes, the decapsulating node,
   and the encapsulating node:

   o  An IOAM encapsulating node configured to incorporate the DEX
      option encapsulates (possibly a subset of) the packets it forwards
      with the DEX option, and MAY export and/or collect the requested
      IOAM data immediately.  Only IOAM encapsulating nodes are allowed
      to add the DEX option type to a packet.

Internet-Draft            IOAM Direct Exporting                 May 2022


   o  A transit node that processes a packet with the DEX option MAY
      export and/or collect the requested IOAM data.

   o  An IOAM decapsulating node that processes a packet with the DEX
      option MAY export and/or collect the requested IOAM data, and MUST
      decapsulate the IOAM header.

   As in [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data], the DEX option can be incorporated
   into all or a subset of the traffic that is forwarded by the
   encapsulating node, as further discussed in Section 3.1.1 below.
   Moreover, IOAM nodes respond to the DEX trigger by exporting and/or
   collecting IOAM data either for all traversing packets that carry the
   DEX option, or selectively only for a subset of these packets, as
   further discussed in Section 3.1.2 below.

3.1.1.  DEX Packet Selection

   If an IOAM encapsulating node incorporates the DEX option into all
   the traffic it forwards it may lead to an excessive amount of
   exported data, which may overload the network and the receiving
   entity.  Therefore, an IOAM encapsulating node that supports the DEX
   option MUST support the ability to incorporate the DEX option
   selectively into a subset of the packets that are forwarded by it.

   Various methods of packet selection and sampling have been previously
   defined, such as [RFC7014] and [RFC5475].  Similar techniques can be
   applied by an IOAM encapsulating node to apply DEX to a subset of the
   forwarded traffic.

   The subset of traffic that is forwarded or transmitted with a DEX
   option SHOULD NOT exceed 1/N of the interface capacity on any of the
   IOAM encapsulating node's interfaces.  It is noted that this
   requirement applies to the total traffic that incorporates a DEX
   option, including traffic that is forwarded by the IOAM encapsulating
   node and probe packets that are generated by the IOAM encapsulating
   node.  In this context N is a parameter that can be configurable by
   network operators.  If there is an upper bound, M, on the number of
   IOAM transit nodes in any path in the network, then it is recommended
   to use an N such that N >> M.  The rationale is that a packet that
   includes a DEX option may trigger an exported packet from each IOAM
   transit node along the path for a total of M exported packets.  Thus,
   if N >> M then the number of exported packets is significantly lower
   than the number of data packets forwarded by the IOAM encapsulating
   node.  If there is no prior knowledge about the network topology or
   size, it is recommended to use N>100.

3.1.2.  Responding to the DEX Trigger

   The DEX option specifies which data fields should be exported and/or
   collected, as specified in Section 3.2.  As mentioned above, the data
   can be locally collected, and optionally can be aggregated and
   exported to a receiving entity, either proactively or on-demand.  If
   IOAM data is exported, the format and encapsulation of the packet
   that contains the exported data is not within the scope of the
   current document.  For example, the export format can be based on
   [I-D.spiegel-ippm-ioam-rawexport].

   An IOAM node that performs DEX-triggered exporting MUST support the
   ability to limit the rate of the exported packets.  The rate of
   exported packets SHOULD be limited so that the number of exported
   packets is significantly lower than the number of packets that are
   forwarded by the device.  The exported data rate SHOULD NOT exceed 1/
   N of the interface capacity on any of the IOAM node's interfaces.  It
   is recommended to use N>100.  Depending on the IOAM node's
   architecture considerations, the export rate may be limited to a
   lower number in order to avoid loading the IOAM node.  An IOAM node
   MAY maintain a counter or a set of counters that count the events in
   which the IOAM node receives a packet with the DEX option type and
   does not collect and/or export data due to the rate limits.

   Exported packets SHOULD NOT be exported over a path or a tunnel that
   is subject to IOAM direct exporting.  Furthermore, IOAM encapsulating
   nodes that can identify a packet as an IOAM exported packet MUST NOT
   push a DEX option into such a packet.  This requirement is intended
   to prevent nested exporting and/or exporting loops.

   A transit or decapsulating IOAM node that receives an unknown IOAM
   option type ignores it (as defined in [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data]), and
   specifically nodes that do not support the DEX option ignore it.
   Note that as per [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data] a decapsulating node
   removes the IOAM encapsulation and all its IOAM options, and
   specifically in the case where one of these options is a (possibly
   unknown) DEX option.  The ability to skip over a (possibly unknown)
   DEX option in the parsing or in the decapsulation procedure is
   dependent on the specific encapsulation, which is outside the scope
   of this document.  For example, when IOAM is encapsulated in IPv6
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-ipv6-options] the DEX option is incorporated
   either in a Hop-by-Hop options header or in a Destination options
   header, and thus can be skipped using the length field in the options
   header.

3.2.  The DEX Option Format

   The format of the DEX option is depicted in Figure 2.  The length of
   the DEX option is at least 8 octets.  The DEX option MAY include one
   or more optional fields.  The existence of the optional fields is
   indicated by the corresponding flags in the Extension-Flags field.
   Two optional fields are defined in this document, the Flow ID and the
   Sequence Number fields.  Every optional field MUST be exactly 4
   octets long.  Thus, the Extension-Flags field explicitly indicates
   the length of the DEX option.  Defining a new optional field requires
   an allocation of a corresponding flag in the Extension-Flags field,
   as specified in Section 4.2.

                        Figure 2: DEX Option Format

   Namespace-ID    A 16-bit identifier of the IOAM namespace, as defined
                   in [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].

   Flags           An 8-bit field, comprised of 8 one-bit subfields.
                   Flags are allocated by IANA, as defined in
                   Section 4.2.

   Extension-Flags An 8-bit field, comprised of 8 one-bit subfields.
                   Extension-Flags are allocated by IANA, as defined in
                   Section 4.3.  Every bit in the Extension-Flag field
                   that is set to 1 indicates the existence of a
                   corresponding optional 4-octet field.  An IOAM node
                   that receives a DEX option with an unknown flag set
                   to 1 MUST ignore the corresponding optional field.

   IOAM-Trace-Type A 24-bit identifier which specifies which data fields
                   should be exported.  The format of this field is as
                   defined in [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].  Specifically,
                   the bit that corresponds to the Checksum Complement

                   data field SHOULD be assigned to be zero by the IOAM
                   encapsulating node, and ignored by transit and
                   decapsulating nodes.  The reason for this is that the
                   Checksum Complement is intended for in-flight packet
                   modifications and is not relevant for direct
                   exporting.

   Reserved        This field SHOULD be ignored by the receiver.

   Optional fields The optional fields, if present, reside after the
                   Reserved field.  The order of the optional fields is
                   according to the respective bits that are enabled in
                   the Extension-Flags field.  Each optional field is 4
                   octets long.

   Flow ID         An optional 32-bit field representing the flow
                   identifier.  If the actual Flow ID is shorter than 32
                   bits, it is zero padded in its most significant bits.
                   The field is set at the encapsulating node.  The Flow
                   ID can be used to correlate the exported data of the
                   same flow from multiple nodes and from multiple
                   packets.  Flow ID values are expected to be allocated
                   in a way that avoids collisions.  For example, random
                   assignment of Flow ID values can be subject to
                   birthday problem conflicts, while centralized
                   allocation can avoid this problem.  The specification
                   of the Flow ID allocation method is not within the
                   scope of this document.

   Sequence Number An optional 32-bit sequence number starting from 0
                   and increasing by 1 for each following monitored
                   packet from the same flow at the encapsulating node.
                   The Sequence Number, when combined with the Flow ID,
                   provides a convenient approach to correlate the
                   exported data from the same user packet.

4.  IANA Considerations

4.1.  IOAM Type

   The "IOAM Type Registry" was defined in Section 7.2 of
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].  IANA is requested to allocate the
   following code point from the "IOAM Type Registry" as follows:

   TBD-type   IOAM Direct Export (DEX) Option Type

   If possible, IANA is requested to allocate code point 4 (TBD-type).

4.2.  IOAM DEX Flags

   IANA is requested to define an "IOAM DEX Flags" registry.  This
   registry includes 8 flag bits.  Allocation is based on the "RFC
   Required" procedure, as defined in [RFC8126].

   New registration requests MUST use the following template:

   Bit:  Desired bit to be allocated in the 8 bit Flags field of the DEX
      option.

   Description:  Brief description of the newly registered bit.

   Reference:  Reference to the document that defines the new bit.

4.3.  IOAM DEX Extension-Flags

   IANA is requested to define an "IOAM DEX Extension-Flags" registry.
   This registry includes 8 flag bits.  Bit 0 (the most significant bit)
   and bit 1 in the registry are allocated by this document, and
   described in Section 3.2.  Allocation of the other bits should be
   performed based on the "RFC Required" procedure, as defined in
   [RFC8126].

   Bit 0  "Flow ID [RFC XXXX] [RFC Editor: please replace with the RFC
      number of the current document]"

   Bit 1  "Sequence Number [RFC XXXX] [RFC Editor: please replace with
      the RFC number of the current document]"

   New registration requests MUST use the following template:

   Bit:  Desired bit to be allocated in the 8 bit Extension-Flags field
      of the DEX option.

   Description:  Brief description of the newly registered bit.

   Reference:  Reference to the document that defines the new bit.

5.  Performance Considerations

   The DEX option triggers IOAM data to be collected and/or exported
   packets to be exported to a receiving entity (or entities).  In some
   cases this may impact the receiving entity's performance, or the
   performance along the paths leading to it.

   Therefore, the performance impact of these exported packets is
   limited by taking two measures: at the encapsulating nodes, by



Song, et al.            Expires November 30, 2022               [Page 9]

   selective DEX encapsulation (Section 3.1.1), and at the transit
   nodes, by limiting exporting rate (Section 3.1.2).  These two
   measures ensure that direct exporting is used at a rate that does not
   significantly affect the network bandwidth, and does not overload the
   receiving entity.  Moreover, it is possible to load balance the
   exported data among multiple receiving entities, although the
   exporting method is not within the scope of this document.

   It should be noted that in some networks DEX data may be exported
   over an out-of-band network, in which a large volume of exported
   traffic does not compromise user traffic.  In this case an operator
   may choose to disable the exporting rate limiting.

6.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of IOAM in general are discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].  Specifically, an attacker may try to use
   the functionality that is defined in this document to attack the
   network.

   An attacker may attempt to overload network devices by injecting
   synthetic packets that include the DEX option.  Similarly, an on-path
   attacker may maliciously incorporate the DEX option into transit
   packets, or maliciously remove it from packets in which it is
   incorporated.

   Forcing DEX, either in synthetic packets or in transit packets may
   overload the receiving entity (or entities).  Since this mechanism
   affects multiple devices along the network path, it potentially
   amplifies the effect on the network bandwidth and on the receiving
   entity's load.

   The amplification effect of DEX may be worse in wide area networks in
   which there are multiple IOAM domains.  For example, if DEX is used
   in IOAM domain 1 for exporting IOAM data to a receiving entity, then
   the exported packets of domain 1 can be forwarded through IOAM domain
   2, in which they are subject to DEX.  The exported packets of domain
   2 may in turn be forwarded through another IOAM domain (or through
   domain 1), and theoretically this recursive amplification may
   continue infinitely.

   In order to mitigate the attacks described above, the following
   requirements (Section 3) have been defined:

   o  Selective DEX (Section 3.1.1) is applied by IOAM encpsulating
      nodes in order to limit the potential impact of DEX attacks to a
      small fraction of the traffic.




Song, et al.            Expires November 30, 2022              [Page 10]

Internet-Draft            IOAM Direct Exporting                 May 2022


   o  Rate limiting of exported traffic (Section 3.1.2) is applied by
      IOAM nodes in order to prevent overloading attacks and in order to
      significantly limit the scale of amplification attacks.

   o  IOAM encapsulating nodes are required to avoid pushing the DEX
      option into IOAM exported packets (Section 3.1.2), thus preventing
      some of the amplification and export loop scenarios.

   Although the exporting method is not within the scope of this
   document, any exporting method MUST secure the exported data from the
   IOAM node to the receiving entity.  Specifically, an IOAM node that
   performs DEX exporting MUST send the exported data to a pre-
   configured trusted receiving entity.  Furthermore, an IOAM node MUST
   gain explicit consent to export data to a receiving entity before
   starting to send exported data.

   An attacker may keep track of the information sent in DEX headers as
   a means of reconnaissance.  This form of recon can be mitigated to
   some extent by careful allocation of the Flow ID and Sequence Number
   space, in a way that does not compromise privacy aspects such as
   customer identities.

   IOAM is assumed to be deployed in a restricted administrative domain,
   thus limiting the scope of the threats above and their affect.  This
   is a fundamental assumption with respect to the security aspects of
   IOAM, as further discussed in [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].

Appendix A.  Hop Limit in Direct Exporting

   In order to help correlate and order the exported packets, it is
   possible to include the Hop_Lim/Node_ID data field in exported
   packets; if the IOAM-Trace-Type [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data] has the

   Hop_Lim/Node_ID bit set, then exported packets include the Hop_Lim/
   Node_ID data field, which contains the TTL/Hop Limit value from a
   lower layer protocol.

   An alternative approach was considered during the design of this
   document, according to which a 1-octet Hop Count field would be
   included in the DEX header (presumably by claiming some space from
   the Flags field).  The Hop Limit would starts from 0 at the
   encapsulating node and be incremented by each IOAM transit node that
   supports the DEX option.  In this approach the Hop Count field value
   would also be included in the exported packet.
