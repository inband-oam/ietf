1.  Introduction

   In-situ OAM (IOAM) records OAM information within the packet while
   the packet traverses a particular network domain.  The term "in-situ"
   refers to the fact that the IOAM data fields are added to the data
   packets rather than is being sent within packets specifically
   dedicated to OAM.  This document proposes a new Geneve tunnel option
   and defines how IOAM data fields are transported as part of the
   tunnel option in the Geneve [I-D.ietf-nvo3-geneve] encapsulation.
   The IOAM data fields are defined in [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].

3.  IOAM Data Field Encapsulation in Geneve

   Geneve is defined in [I-D.ietf-nvo3-geneve].  When Geneve
   encapsulation header is used, IOAM data fields can either be carried
   after the Geneve header, identified by the next protocol field or can
   be carried in the Geneve header itself as a tunnel option.  The
   former approach is defined in [I-D.weis-ippm-ioam-eth] while the
   latter approach is defined in this document.

   IOAM data fields are carried using a single Geneve Option Class
   TBD_IOAM.  The different IOAM data fields defined in
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data] are added as TLVs using that Geneve Option
   Class.  In an administrative domain where IOAM is used, insertion of
   the IOAM header in Geneve is enabled at the Geneve tunnel endpoints,
   which also serve as IOAM encapsulating/decapsulating nodes by means
   of configuration.

                Figure 1: IOAM data encapsulation in Geneve

   The Geneve header and fields are defined in [I-D.ietf-nvo3-geneve].
   The Geneve Option Class value for use with IOAM is TBD_IOAM.

   The fields related to the encapsulation of IOAM data fields in Geneve
   are defined as follows:

   Option Class:  16-bit unsigned integer that determines the IOAM
      option class.  The value is from the IANA registry setup for
      Geneve option classes as defined in [I-D.ietf-nvo3-geneve].

   Type:  8-bit field defining the IOAM Option type, as defined in
      Section 7.2 of [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].  The 'C' bit MUST be set
      to zero.

   R (3 bits):  Option control flags reserved for future use.  The flags
      MUST be set to zero on transmission and ignored on receipt.

   Length:  5-bit unsigned integer.  Length of the IOAM HDR in 4-octet
      units.

   IOAM Option and Data Space:  IOAM option header and data is present
      as defined by the Type field, and is defined in Section 4 of
      [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].

   Multiple distinct IOAM Option-Types MAY be included within the same
   Geneve encapsulation.  Each IOAM Option-Type MUST occur at most once
   within the same Geneve encapsulation.  For example, if a Geneve
   encapsulation contains two IOAM Option-Types before a data payload,
   there would be two fields with TBD_IOAM Option Class each,
   differentiated by the Type field which specifies the type of the IOAM
   data included.

4.  Considerations

   This section summarizes a set of considerations on the overall
   approach taken for IOAM data encapsulation in Geneve, as well as
   deployment considerations.

4.1.  Discussion of the encapsulation approach

   This section is to support the working group discussion in selecting
   the most appropriate approach for encapsulating IOAM data fields in
   Geneve.

   An encapsulation of IOAM data fields in Geneve should be friendly to
   an implementation in both hardware as well as software forwarders and
   support a wide range of deployment cases, including large networks
   that desire to leverage multiple IOAM data fields at the same time.

      Hardware and software friendly implementation: Hardware forwarders
      benefit from an encapsulation that minimizes iterative look-ups of
      fields within the packet: Any operation which looks up the value
      of a field within the packet, based on which another lookup is
      performed, consumes additional gates and time in an implementation
      - both of which are desired to be kept to a minimum.  This means
      that flat TLV structures are to be preferred over nested TLV
      structures.  IOAM data fields are grouped into three option
      categories: Trace, proof-of-transit, and edge-to-edge.  Each of
      these three options defines a TLV structure.  A hardware-friendly
      encapsulation approach avoids grouping these three option
      categories into yet another TLV structure, but would rather carry
      the options as a serial sequence.

      Total length of the IOAM data fields: The total length of IOAM
      data can grow quite large in case multiple different IOAM data
      fields are used and large path-lengths need to be considered.  If
      for example an operator would consider using the IOAM trace option
      and capture node-id, app_data, egress/ingress interface-id,
      timestamp seconds, timestamps nanoseconds at every hop, then a
      total of 20 octets would be added to the packet at every hop.  In
      case this particular deployment would have a maximum path length




Brockners, et al.      Expires September 30, 2020               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft      In-situ OAM Geneve encapsulation          March 2020


      of 15 hops in the IOAM domain, then a maximum of 300 octets of
      IOAM data were to be encapsulated in the packet.

   Concerns with the current encapsulation approach:

      Hardware support: Using Geneve tunnel options to encapsulate IOAM
      data fields leads to a nested TLV structure.  Each IOAM data field
      option (trace, proof-of-transit, and edge-to-edge) represents a
      type, with the different IOAM data fields being TLVs within this
      the particular option type.  Nested TLVs require iterative look-
      ups, a fact that creates potential challenges for implementations
      in hardware.  It would be desirable to offer a way to encapsulate
      IOAM in a way that keeps TLV nesting to a minimum.

      Length: Geneve tunnel option length is a 5-bit field in the
      current specification [I-D.ietf-nvo3-geneve] resulting in a
      maximum option length of 128 (2^5 x 4) octets which constrains the
      use of IOAM to either small domains or a few IOAM data fields
      only.  Support for large domains with a variety of IOAM data
      fields would be desirable.

4.2.  IOAM and the use of the Geneve O-bit

   [I-D.ietf-nvo3-geneve] defines an "O bit" for Control packets.  Per
   [I-D.ietf-nvo3-geneve] the O bit indicates that the packet contains a
   control message instead of data payload.  Packets that carry IOAM
   data fields in addition to regular data payload / customer traffic
   must not set the O bit.  Packets that carry only IOAM data fields
   without any payload must set the O bit.

4.3.  Transit devices

   If IOAM is deployed in domains where UDP port numbers are not
   controlled and do not have a domain-wide meaning, such as on the
   global Internet, transit devices MUST NOT attempt to modify the IOAM
   data contained in the IOAM option class.  In case UDP port numbers
   are not controlled there might be UDP packets, which leverage the UDP
   port number that Geneve utilizes, i.e. 6081, but the payload of these
   packets isn't Geneve.  The scenario and associated reasoning is
   discussed in [RFC7605] which states that "it is important to
   recognize that any interpretation of port numbers -- except at the
   endpoints -- may be incorrect, because port numbers are meaningful
   only at the endpoints."

Internet-Draft      In-situ OAM Geneve encapsulation          March 2020


4.4.  Additional Encapsulation Consideration

   Geneve encapsulation header supports carrying IOAM data fields either
   as part of the tunnel option or as the protocol data unit that
   follows the Geneve header.  An operator may choose to enable either
   of the options but it is not recommended to include both in the same
   data packet.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate a Geneve "option class" numbers for
   IOAM:

                 +---------------+-------------+---------------+
                 | Option Class  | Description | Reference     |
                 +---------------+-------------+---------------+
                 | x             | TBD_IOAM    | This document |
                 +---------------+-------------+---------------+


6.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of Geneve are discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-nvo3-geneve], and the security considerations of IOAM in
   general are discussed in [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].

   IOAM is considered a "per domain" feature, where one or several
   operators decide on leveraging and configuring IOAM according to
   their needs.  Still, operators need to properly secure the IOAM
   domain to avoid malicious configuration and use, which could include
   injecting malicious IOAM packets into a domain.
