1.  Introduction

   In-situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM) records
   operational and telemetry information in the packet while the packet
   traverses a path between two points in the network.  This document
   outlines how IOAM data fields are encapsulated in the IPv6 [RFC8200]
   and discusses deployment options for networks that use
   IPv6-encapsulated IOAM data fields.  These options have distinct
   deployment considerations; for example, the IOAM domain can either be
   between hosts, or be between IOAM encapsulating and decapsulating
   network nodes that forward traffic, such as routers.

3.  In-situ OAM Metadata Transport in IPv6

   In-situ OAM in IPv6 is used to enhance diagnostics of IPv6 networks.
   It complements other mechanisms designed to enhance diagnostics of
   IPv6 networks, such as the IPv6 Performance and Diagnostic Metrics
   Destination Option described in [RFC8250].

   IOAM data fields can be encapsulated in "option data" fields using
   two types of extension headers in IPv6 packets - either Hop-by-Hop
   Options header or Destination options header.  Deployments select one
   of these extension header types depending on how IOAM is used, as
   described in section 4 of [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].  Multiple

   options with the same Option Type MAY appear in the same Hop-by-Hop
   Options or Destination Options header, with distinct content.

   In order for IOAM to work in IPv6 networks, IOAM MUST be explicitly
   enabled per interface on every node within the IOAM domain.  Unless a
   particular interface is explicitly enabled (i.e., explicitly
   configured) for IOAM, a router MUST drop packets that contain
   extension headers carrying IOAM data-fields.  This is the default
   behavior and is independent of whether the Hop-by-Hop options or
   Destination options are used to encode the IOAM data.  This ensures
   that IOAM data does not unintentionally get forwarded outside the
   IOAM domain.

   An IPv6 packet carrying IOAM data in an Extension header can have
   other extension headers, compliant with [RFC8200].

   IOAM Type:  8-bit field as defined in section 7.2 in
      [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].

   Option Data:  Variable-length field.  Option-Type-specific data.

   In-situ OAM Option-Types are inserted as Option data as follows:

   1.  Pre-allocated Trace Option: The in-situ OAM Preallocated Trace
       Option-Type defined in [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data] is represented
       as an IPv6 option in the Hop-by-Hop extension header:

       Option Type:  001xxxxx 8-bit identifier of the IOAM type of
          option. xxxxx=TBD.

       IOAM Option-Type:  IOAM Pre-allocated Trace Option-Type.

   2.  Incremental Trace Option: The in-situ OAM Incremental Trace
       Option-Type defined in [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data] is represented
       as an IPv6 option in the Hop-by-Hop extension header:

       Option Type:  001xxxxx 8-bit identifier of the IOAM type of
          option. xxxxx=TBD.

       IOAM Option-Type:  IOAM Incremental Trace Option-Type.

   3.  Proof of Transit Option: The in-situ OAM POT Option-Type defined
       in [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data] is represented as an IPv6 option in
       the Hop-by-Hop extension header:

       Option Type:  001xxxxx 8-bit identifier of the IOAM type of
          option. xxxxx=TBD.

       IOAM Option-Type:  IOAM POT Option-Type.

   4.  Edge to Edge Option: The in-situ OAM E2E option defined in
       [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data] is represented as an IPv6 option in
       Destination extension header:

       Option Type:  000xxxxx 8-bit identifier of the IOAM type of
          option. xxxxx=TBD.

       IOAM Option-Type:  IOAM E2E Option-Type.

   5.  Direct Export (DEX) Option: The in-situ OAM Direct Export Option-
       Type defined in [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-direct-export] is represented
       as an IPv6 option in the Hop-by-Hop extension header:

       Option Type:  000xxxxx 8-bit identifier of the IOAM type of
          option. xxxxx=TBD.

       IOAM Option-Type:  IOAM Direct Export (DEX) Option-Type.

   All the in-situ OAM IPv6 options defined here have alignment
   requirements.  Specifically, they all require 4n alignment.  This
   ensures that fields specified in [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data] are
   aligned at a multiple-of-4 offset from the start of the Hop-by-Hop
   and Destination Options header.  In addition, to maintain IPv6
   extension header 8-octet alignment and avoid the need to add or
   remove padding at every hop, the Trace-Type for Incremental Trace
   Option in IPv6 MUST be selected such that the IOAM node data length
   is a multiple of 8-octets.

   IPv6 options can have a maximum length of 255 octets.  Consequently,
   the total lenght of IOAM Option-Types including all data fields is
   also limited to 255 octets when encapsulated into IPv6.

4.  IOAM Deployment In IPv6 Networks

4.1.  Considerations for IOAM deployment in IPv6 networks

   IOAM deployments in IPv6 networks should take the following
   considerations and requirements into account:

   C1 It is desirable that the addition of IOAM data fields neither
      changes the way routers forward packets nor the forwarding
      decisions the routers take.  Packets with added OAM information
      should follow the same path within the domain that an identical
      packet without OAM information would follow, even in the presence
      of ECMP.  Such behavior is particularly important for deployments
      where IOAM data fields are only added "on-demand", e.g., to
      provide further insights in case of undesired network behavior for
      certain flows.  Implementations of IOAM SHOULD ensure that ECMP
      behavior for packets with and without IOAM data fields is the
      same.

   C2 Given that IOAM data fields increase the total size of a packet,
      the size of a packet including the IOAM data could exceed the
      PMTU.  In particular, the incremental trace IOAM Hop-by-Hop (HbH)
      Option, which is intended to support hardware implementations of
      IOAM, changes Option Data Length en-route.  Operators of an IOAM
      domain SHOULD ensure that the addition of OAM information does not
      lead to fragmentation of the packet, e.g., by configuring the MTU
      of transit routers and switches to a sufficiently high value.
      Careful control of the MTU in a network is one of the reasons why
      IOAM is considered a domain-specific feature (see also



Bhandari, et al.         Expires August 25, 2021                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft       In-situ OAM IPv6 encapsulation        February 2021


      [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data]).  In addition, the PMTU tolerance range
      in the IOAM domain should be identified (e.g., through
      configuration) and IOAM encapsulation operations and/or IOAM data
      field insertion (in case of incremental tracing) should not be
      performed if it exceeds the packet size beyond PMTU.

   C3 Packets with IOAM data or associated ICMP errors, should not
      arrive at destinations that have no knowledge of IOAM.  For
      exmample, if IOAM is used in in transit devices, misleading ICMP
      errors due to addition and/or presence of OAM data in a packet
      could confuse the host that sent the packet if it did not insert
      the OAM information.

   C4 OAM data leaks can affect the forwarding behavior and state of
      network elements outside an IOAM domain.  IOAM domains SHOULD
      provide a mechanism to prevent data leaks or be able to ensure
      that if a leak occurs, network elements outside the domain are not
      affected (i.e., they continue to process other valid packets).

   C5 The source that inserts and leaks the IOAM data needs to be easy
      to identify for the purpose of troubleshooting, due to the high
      complexity of troubleshooting a source that inserted the IOAM data
      and did not remove it when the packet traversed across an
      Autonomous System (AS).  Such a troubleshooting process might
      require coordination between multiple operators, complex
      configuration verification, packet capture analysis, etc.

   C6 Compliance with [RFC8200] requires OAM data to be encapsulated
      instead of header/option insertion directly into in-flight packets
      using the original IPv6 header.

4.2.  IOAM domains bounded by hosts

   For deployments where the IOAM domain is bounded by hosts, hosts will
   perform the operation of IOAM data field encapsulation and
   decapsulation.  IOAM data is carried in IPv6 packets as Hop-by-Hop or
   Destination options as specified in this document.

4.3.  IOAM domains bounded by network devices

   For deployments where the IOAM domain is bounded by network devices,
   network devices such as routers form the edge of an IOAM domain.
   Network devices will perform the operation of IOAM data field
   encapsulation and decapsulation.

4.4.  Deployment options

   This section lists out possible deployment options that can be
   employed to meet the requirements listed in Section 4.1.

4.4.1.  IPv6-in-IPv6 encapsulation

   The "IPv6-in-IPv6" approach preserves the original IP packet and add
   an IPv6 header including IOAM data fields in an extension header in
   front of it, to forward traffic within and across an IOAM domain.
   The overlay network formed by the additional IPv6 header with the
   IOAM data fields included in an extension header is referred to as
   IOAM Overlay Network (ION) in this document.

   The following steps should be taken to perform an IPv6-in-IPv6
   approach:

   1.  The source address of the outer IPv6 header is that of the IOAM
       encapsulating node.  The destination address of the outer IPv6
       header is the same as the inner IPv6 destination address, i.e.,
       the destination address of the packet does not change.

   2.  To simplify debugging in case of leaked IOAM data fields,
       consider a new IOAM E2E destination option to identify the Source
       IOAM domain (AS, v6 prefix).  Insert this option into the IOAM
       destination options EH attached to the outer IPv6 header.  This
       additional information would allow for easy identification of an
       AS operator that is the source of packets with leaked IOAM
       information.  Note that leaked packets with IOAM data fields
       would only occur in case a router would be misconfigured.

   3.  All the IOAM options are defined with type "00" - skip over this
       option and continue processing the header.  Presence of these
       options must not cause packet drops in network elements that do
       not understand the option.  In addition,
       [I-D.ietf-6man-hbh-header-handling] should be considered.

4.4.2.  IP-in-IPv6 encapsulation with ULA

   The "IP-in-IPv6 encapsulation with ULA" [RFC4193] approach can be
   used to apply IOAM to either an IPv6 or an IPv4 network.  In
   addition, it fulfills requirement C4 (avoid leaks) by using ULA for
   the ION.  Similar to the IPv6-in-IPv6 encapsulation approach above,
   the original IP packet is preserved.  An IPv6 header including IOAM
   data fields in an extension header is added in front of it, to
   forward traffic within and across the IOAM domain.  IPv6 addresses
   for the ION, i.e. the outer IPv6 addresses are assigned from the ULA
   space.  Addressing and routing in the ION are to be configured so

   that the IP-in-IPv6 encapsulated packets follow the same path as the
   original, non-encapsulated packet would have taken.  This would
   create an internal IPv6 forwarding topology using the IOAM domain's
   interior ULA address space which is parallel with the forwarding
   topology that exists with the non-IOAM address space (the topology
   and address space that would be followed by packets that do not have
   supplemental IOAM information).  Establishment and maintenance of the
   parallel IOAM ULA forwarding topology could be automated, e.g.,
   similar to how LDP [RFC5036] is used in MPLS to establish and
   maintain an LSP forwarding topology that is parallel to the network's
   IGP forwarding topology.

   Transit across the ION could leverage the transit approach for
   traffic between BGP border routers, as described in [RFC1772], "A.2.3
   Encapsulation".  Assuming that the operational guidelines specified
   in Section 4 of [RFC4193] are properly followed, the probability of
   leaks in this approach will be almost close to zero.  If the packets
   do leak through IOAM egress device misconfiguration or partial IOAM
   egress device failure, the packets' ULA destination address is
   invalid outside of the IOAM domain.  There is no exterior destination
   to be reached, and the packets will be dropped when they encounter
   either a router external to the IOAM domain that has a packet filter
   that drops packets with ULA destinations, or a router that does not
   have a default route.

4.4.3.  x-in-IPv6 Encapsulation that is used Independently

   In some cases it is desirable to monitor a domain that uses an
   overlay network that is deployed independently of the need for IOAM,
   e.g., an overlay network that runs Geneve-in-IPv6, or VXLAN-in-IPv6.
   In this case IOAM can be encapsulated in as an extension header in
   the tunnel (outer) IPv6 header.  Thus, the tunnel encapsulating node
   is also the IOAM encapsulating node, and the tunnel end point is also
   the IOAM decapsulating node.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document describes the encapsulation of IOAM data fields in
   IPv6.  Security considerations of the specific IOAM data fields for
   each case (i.e., Trace, Proof of Transit, and E2E) are described and
   defined in [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].

   As this document describes new options for IPv6, these are similar to
   the security considerations of [RFC8200] and the weakness documented
   in [RFC8250].
