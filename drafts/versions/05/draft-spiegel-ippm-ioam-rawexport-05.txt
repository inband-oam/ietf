Internet-Draft            IOAM raw data export                 July 2021


1.  Introduction

   In-situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM) records
   operational and telemetry information in the packet while the packet
   traverses a path between two points in the network.  IOAM data fields
   are defined in [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].  This document discusses
   how In-situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM)
   information can be exported in raw format, i.e. uninterpreted format,
   from network devices to systems, such as monitoring or analytics
   systems using IPFIX [RFC7011].

   "Raw export of IOAM data" refers to a mode of operation where a node
   exports the IOAM data as it is received in the packet.  The exporting
   node neither interprets, aggregates nor reformats the IOAM data
   before it is exported.  Raw export of IOAM data is to support an
   operational model where the processing and interpretation of IOAM
   data is decoupled from the operation of encapsulating/updating/
   decapsulating IOAM data, which is also referred to as IOAM data-plane
   operation.  The figure below shows the separation of concerns for
   IOAM export: Exporting IOAM data is performed by the "IOAM node"
   which performs IOAM data-plane operation, whereas the interpretation
   of IOAM data is performed by the IOAM data processing system.  The
   separation of concerns is to off-load interpretation, aggregation and
   formatting of IOAM data from the node which performs data-plane
   operations.  In other words, a node which is focused on data-plane
   operations, i.e. forwarding of packets and handling IOAM data will
   not be tasked to also interpret the IOAM data, but can leave this
   task to another system.  Note that for scalability reasons, a single
   IOAM node could choose to export IOAM data to several IOAM data
   processing systems.

    IOAM node: IOAM encapsulating, IOAM decapsulating or
               IOAM transit node.

    IOAM data processing system: System that receives raw IOAM data
               and provides for formatting, aggregation and
               interpretation of the IOAM data.

    Monitoring/Analytics system: System that receives telemetry and
               other operational information from a variety of
               sources and provides for correlation and
               interpretation of the data received.

   Raw export of IOAM data is typically generated by network devices at
   the edges of the network.  Deployment and use-case dependent, such as
   in case of direct export [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-direct-export] or in
   cases where the operator is interested in dropped packets, raw export
   of IOAM data may be generated by IOAM transit nodes.

1.1.  Requirements

   Requirements for raw export of IOAM data:

   *  Export all IOAM information contained in a packet.



Spiegel, et al.          Expires 13 January 2022                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft            IOAM raw data export                 July 2021


   *  Export a specific IOAM data type - Incremental Trace type,
      Preallocated Trace type, Proof of Transit type, Edge to Edge type,
      Direct Export type.

   *  Export IOAM trace data associated with a packet, even if that data
      was never included in a transmitted or received packet in the
      network, for example in case of direct export.

   *  Support coalescing of the IOAM data from multiple packets into a
      single raw export packet.

   *  Support export of additional parts of the packet, other than the
      IOAM data as part of the raw export.  This could be parts of the
      packet header and/or parts of the packet payload.  This additional
      information provides context to the IOAM data (e.g. to be used for
      flow identification) and is to enable the IOAM data processing
      system to perform further analysis on the received data.

   *  Report the reason why IOAM data was exported.  The "reason for
      export" is to complement the IOAM data retrieved from the packet.
      For example, if a packet was dropped by a node due to congestion,
      it could be helpful to export the IOAM data of this dropped packet
      along with an indication that the packet that the IOAM data
      belongs to was dropped due to congestion.

1.2.  Scope

   This document discusses raw export of IOAM data using IPFIX.

   The following is considered out of scope for this document:

   *  Protocols other than IPFIX for raw export of IOAM data.

   *  Interpretation or aggregation of IOAM data prior to exporting.

   *  Configuration of network devices so that they can determine when
      to generate IOAM reports, and what information to include in those
      reports.

   *  Events that trigger generation of IOAM reports.

   *  Selection of particular destinations within distributed telemetry
      monitoring systems, to which IOAM reports will be sent.

   *  Export format for flow statistics or processed/interpreted/
      aggregated IOAM data.

   POT:       Proof of Transit

3.  IPFIX for IOAM raw data export

   IPFIX, being a generic export protocol, can export any Information
   Elements as long as they are described in the information model.  The
   IPFIX protocol is well suited for and is defined as the protocol for
   exporting packet samples in [RFC5476].

   IPFIX/PSAMP [RFC7011], [RFC5476] already define many of the
   information elements needed for exporting sections of packets needed
   for deriving context and raw IOAM data export.  This document
   specifies extensions of the IPFIX information model for meeting the
   requirements in Section 1.1.

3.1.  Key IPFIX information elements leveraged for IOAM raw data export

   The existing IPFIX Information Elements that are required for IOAM
   raw data export are listed here.  Their details are available in
   IANA's IPFIX registry [IANA-IPFIX].

   The existing IPFIX Information Elements used to carry the sections of
   the packets including IOAM data within it are as follows:

   313  - ipHeaderPacketSection

   315  - dataLinkFrameSection

   The following Information Elements will be used to provide context to
   the ipHeaderPacketSection and dataLinkFrameSection as described in
   [IANA-IPFIX]:

   408  - dataLinkFrameType

   409  - sectionOffset

   410  - sectionExportedOctets

   The following Information Element will be used to provide forwarding
   status of the flow and any attached reasons.

   89  - forwardingStatus

3.2.  New IPFIX information elements leveraged for IOAM raw data export

   IOAM data raw export using IPFIX requires a set of new information
   elements which are described in this section.

3.2.1.  ioamReportFlags

   Description:

   This Information Element describes properties associated with an IOAM
   report.

   The ioamReportFlags data type is an 8-bit field.  The following bits

   Bit 1  Congested Queue Association - Indicates the presence of
      congestion on a monitored queue.

   Bit 2  Tracked Flow Association - Matched a flow of interest.

   Bit 3-7  Reserved

   Description:

   This Information Element carries a series of n octets from the IEEE
   802.3 Ethernet frame of a sampled packet, starting after the preamble
   and start frame delimiter (SFD), plus sectionOffset octets into the
   frame if there is a sectionOffset field corresponding to this
   Information Element.

   With sufficient length, this element also reports octets from the
   Ethernet payload.  However, full packet capture of arbitrary packet
   streams is explicitly out of scope per the Security Considerations
   sections of [RFC5477] and [RFC2804].

   When this Information Element has a fixed length, this MAY include
   padding octets that are used to fill out that fixed length.

   When this information element has a variable length, the variable
   length MAY include up to 3 octets of padding, used to preserve
   4-octet alignment of subequent Information Elements or subsequent
   records within the same set.

   In either case of fixed or variable length, the amount of populated
   octets MAY be specified in the sectionExportedOctets field
   corresponding to this Information Element, in which case the
   remainder (if any) MUST be padding.  If there is no
   sectionExportedOctets field corresponding to this Information
   Element, then all octets MUST be populated unless the total length of
   the Ethernet frame is less than the fixed length of this Information
   Element, in which case the remainder MUST be padding.
