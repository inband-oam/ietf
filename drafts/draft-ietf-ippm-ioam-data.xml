    <section title="Introduction" toc="default">
      <t>This document defines data fields for "in-situ" Operations,
      Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM). In-situ OAM records OAM
      information within the packet while the packet traverses a particular
      network domain. The term "in-situ" refers to the fact that the OAM data
      is added to the data packets rather than being sent within packets
      specifically dedicated to OAM. IOAM is to complement mechanisms such as
      Ping or Traceroute. In terms of "active" or "passive" OAM, "in-situ" OAM
      can be considered a hybrid OAM type. "In-situ" mechanisms do not require
      extra packets to be sent. IOAM adds information to the already available
      data packets and therefore cannot be considered passive. In terms of the
      classification given in <xref target="RFC7799"/>, IOAM could be portrayed
      as Hybrid Type I. IOAM mechanisms can be leveraged where mechanisms
      using, e.g., ICMP do not apply or do not offer the desired results, such
      as proving that a certain traffic flow takes a pre-defined path, SLA
      verification for the data traffic, detailed statistics on traffic
      distribution paths in networks that distribute traffic across multiple
      paths, or scenarios in which probe traffic is potentially handled
      differently from regular data traffic by the network devices.</t>

      <t> The term "in situ OAM" was originally motivated by the use
      of OAM related mechanisms that add information into a packet. This
      document uses IOAM as a term defining the IOAM technology. IOAM
      includes "in-situ" mechanisms, but also mechanisms that could trigger 
      the creation of additional packets dedicated to OAM.

    <section title="Scope, Applicability, and Assumptions" anchor="IOAM_scope">
      <t>IOAM assumes a set of constraints as well as 
      guiding principles and concepts that go hand in hand with the definition
      of the IOAM data fields. These constraints, guiding principles, and
      concepts are described in this section. A discussion of how IOAM data 
      fields and the associated concepts are applied to an IOAM deployment
      are out of scope for this document. Please refer to 
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-deployment"/> for IOAM
      deployment considerations.

      </t>

      <t>Scope: This document defines the data fields and associated data
      types for in-situ OAM. The in-situ OAM data fields can be encapsulated in
      a variety of protocols, including NSH, Segment Routing, Geneve, and IPv6.
      Specification details for these different protocols are outside
      the scope of this document. It is expected that each such encapsulation
	  would be specified by an RFC, jointly designed by the working group
	  that develops or maintains the encapsulation protocol and the IETF IPPM
	  working group.</t>

      <t>Deployment domain (or scope) of in-situ OAM deployment: IOAM is
      focused on "limited domains" as defined in <xref target="RFC8799"/>.
      For IOAM, a limited domain could for example be an enterprise campus
      using physical connections between devices or an overlay network using virtual
      connections / tunnels for connectivity between said devices. 

      A limited domain which uses IOAM may constitute one or multiple 
      "IOAM-domains", each disambiguated through separate namespace identifiers.
      An IOAM-domain is bounded by its perimeter or edge.  IOAM-domains 
      may overlap inside the limited domain.

      Designers of protocol
      encapsulations for IOAM specify mechanisms to ensure that IOAM data
      stays within an IOAM-domain. In addition, the operator of such a domain
      is expected to put provisions in place to ensure that IOAM data does not
      leak beyond the edge of an IOAM-domain using, for example, packet
      filtering methods. The operator SHOULD consider the potential
      operational impact of IOAM to mechanisms such as ECMP processing (e.g.,
      load-balancing schemes based on packet length could be impacted by the
      increased packet size due to IOAM), path MTU (i.e., ensure that the MTU
      of all links within a domain is sufficiently large to support the
      increased packet size due to IOAM) and ICMP message handling (i.e., in
      case of IPv6, IOAM support for ICMPv6 Echo Request/Reply is desired
      which would translate into ICMPv6 extensions to enable IOAM-Data-Fields
      to be copied from an Echo Request message to an Echo Reply message).</t>

      <t>IOAM control points: IOAM-Data-Fields are added to or removed from
      the user traffic by the devices which form the edge of a domain.
      Devices which form an IOAM-Domain can add, update or remove
      IOAM-Data-Fields. Edge devices of an IOAM-Domain can be hosts or network
      devices.</t>

      <t>Traffic-sets that IOAM is applied to: IOAM can be deployed on all or
      only on subsets of the user traffic. Using IOAM on a selected set
      of traffic (e.g., per interface, based on an access control list or flow
      specification defining a specific set of traffic, etc.) could be useful
      in deployments where the cost of processing IOAM-Data-Fields by
      encapsulating, transit, or decapsulating node(s) might be a concern from
      a performance or operational perspective. Thus limiting the amount of
      traffic IOAM is applied to could be beneficial in some deployments.</t>

      <t>Encapsulation independence: The definition of IOAM-Data-Fields is
      independent from the protocols the IOAM-Data-Fields are encapsulated
      into. IOAM-Data-Fields can be encapsulated into several encapsulating
      protocols.</t>

      <t>Layering: If several encapsulation protocols (e.g., in case of
      tunneling) are stacked on top of each other, IOAM-Data-Fields could be
      present at multiple layers. The behavior follows the ships-in-the-night
      model, i.e., IOAM-Data-Fields in one layer are independent from
      IOAM-Data-Fields in another layer. Layering allows operators to
      instrument the protocol layer they want to measure. The different layers
      could, but do not have to, share the same IOAM encapsulation
      mechanisms.</t>

      <t>IOAM implementation: The definition of the IOAM-Data-Fields take the
      specifics of devices with hardware data planes and software data planes
      into account.</t>

    <section anchor="IOAM_option_format"
             title="IOAM Data-Fields, Types, Nodes">
      <t>This section details IOAM-related nomenclature and describes data
      types such as IOAM-Data-Fields, IOAM-Types, IOAM-Namespaces as well as
      the different types of IOAM nodes.</t>

      <section title="IOAM Data-Fields and Option-Types">
        <t>An IOAM-Data-Field is a set of bits with a defined format and
        meaning, which can be stored at a certain place in a packet for the
        purpose of IOAM.</t>

        <t>To accommodate the different uses of IOAM, IOAM-Data-Fields fall
        into different categories. In IOAM, these categories are referred to as
        IOAM-Option-Types. A common registry is maintained for
        IOAM-Option-Types, see <xref target="IOAM-type-registry"/> for
        details. Corresponding to these IOAM-Option-Types, different
        IOAM-Data-Fields are defined.</t>

        <t>This document defines four IOAM-Option-Types:<list style="symbols">

      </section>

      <section title="IOAM-Domains and types of IOAM Nodes">
        <t><xref target="IOAM_scope"/> already mentioned that IOAM is expected to be deployed in a limited domain <xref target="RFC8799"/>. 
        One or more IOAM-Option-Types are added to a packet upon entering an
        IOAM-Domain and are removed from the packet when exiting the domain.
        Within the IOAM-Domain, the IOAM-Data-Fields MAY be updated by network
        nodes that the packet traverses. An IOAM-Domain consists of "IOAM
        encapsulating nodes", "IOAM decapsulating nodes" and "IOAM transit
        nodes". The role of a node (i.e., encapsulating, transit,
        decapsulating) is defined within an IOAM-Namespace (see below). A node
        can have different roles in different IOAM-Namespaces.</t>

        <t>A device which adds at least one IOAM-Option-Type to the packet is
        called an "IOAM encapsulating node", whereas a device which removes
        an IOAM-Option-Type is referred to as an "IOAM decapsulating node".
        Nodes within the domain which are aware of IOAM data and
        read and/or write and/or process IOAM data
        are called "IOAM transit nodes". IOAM
        nodes which add or remove the IOAM-Data-Fields can also update the
        IOAM-Data-Fields at the same time. Or in other words, IOAM
        encapsulating or decapsulating nodes can also serve as IOAM transit
        nodes at the same time. Note that not every node in an IOAM-domain
        needs to be an IOAM transit node. For example, a deployment might
        require that packets traverse a set of firewalls which support IOAM.
        In that case, only the set of firewall nodes would be IOAM transit
        nodes rather than all nodes.</t>

        <t>An "IOAM encapsulating node" incorporates one or more
        IOAM-Option-Types (from the list of IOAM-Types, see <xref
        target="IOAM-type-registry"/>) into packets that IOAM is enabled for.
        If IOAM is enabled for a selected subset of the traffic, the IOAM
        encapsulating node is responsible for applying the IOAM functionality
        to the selected subset.</t>

        <t>An "IOAM transit node" reads and/or writes and/or processes
        one or more of the IOAM-Data-Fields.
        If both the Pre-allocated and the Incremental Trace Option-Types are
        present in the packet, each IOAM transit node based on configuration and
	    available implementation of IOAM might populate IOAM trace data in
	    either Pre-allocated or Incremental Trace Option-Type but not both.
        Note that not populating any of the Trace Option-Types is also valid
 	 behavior for an IOAM transit node.
        A transit node MUST ignore IOAM-Option-Types that it does not
        understand. A transit node MUST NOT add new IOAM-Option-Types to a
        packet, MUST NOT remove IOAM-Option-Types from a packet, and
        MUST NOT change the IOAM-Data-Fields of an IOAM Edge-to-Edge
        Option-Type.</t>

        <t>An "IOAM decapsulating node" removes IOAM-Option-Type(s) from
        packets.</t>

        <t>The role of an IOAM-encapsulating, IOAM-transit or
        IOAM-decapsulating node is always performed within a specific
        IOAM-Namespace. This means that an IOAM node which is, e.g., an
        IOAM-decapsulating node for IOAM-Namespace "A" but not for
        IOAM-Namespace "B" will only remove the IOAM-Option-Types for
        IOAM-Namespace "A" from the packet. Note that this applies even
        for IOAM-Option-Types that the node does not understand, for
        example an IOAM-Option-Type other than the four described above,
        that is added in a future revision.</t>

        <t>IOAM-Namespaces allow for a namespace-specific definition and
        interpretation of IOAM-Data-Fields. An interface-id could for example
        point to a physical interface (e.g., to understand which physical
        interface of an aggregated link is used when receiving or transmitting
        a packet) whereas in another case it could refer to a logical
        interface (e.g., in case of tunnels). Please refer to <xref
        target="ioam_namespaces"/> for details on IOAM-Namespaces.</t>

        <t>IOAM-Namespaces add further context to IOAM-Option-Types and
        associated IOAM-Data-Fields. The IOAM-Option-Types and associated 
		IOAM-Data-Fields are interpreted as defined in this document, 
		regardless of the value of the IOAM-Namespace. However, 
		IOAM-Namespaces provide a way to group nodes to 
		support different deployment approaches
		of IOAM (see a few example use-cases below). IOAM-Namespaces also
		help to resolve potential issues which can occur due to IOAM-Data-Fields not
        being globally unique (e.g., IOAM node identifiers do not have to be
        globally unique). IOAM-Data-Fields significance is always within a
        particular IOAM-Namespace. Given that IOAM-Data-Fields are always 
        interpreted the context of a specific namespace, the namespace-id 
        field always needs to be carried along with the IOAM data-fields themselves.</t>

        <t>An IOAM-Namespace is identified by a 16-bit namespace identifier
        (Namespace-ID). The IOAM-Namespace field is included in all the 
		IOAM-Option-Types defined in this document, and MUST be included 
		in all future IOAM-Option-Types. The Namespace-ID value is divided
        into two sub-ranges:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>An operator-assigned range from 0x0001 to 0x7FFF</t>

            <t>An IANA-assigned range from 0x8000 to 0xFFFF</t>
          </list>The IANA-assigned range is intended to allow future
        extensions to have new and interoperable IOAM functionality, while the
        operator-assigned range is intended to be domain-specific, and managed
        by the network operator. The Namespace-ID value of 0x0000 is the 
		"Default-Namespace-ID". The Default-Namespace-ID indicates that no 
		specific namespace is associated with the IOAM data fields in the 
		packet. The Default-Namespace-ID MUST be supported by all nodes 
		implementing IOAM. A use-case for the Default-Namespace-ID are 
		deployments which do not leverage specific namespaces for some or all 
		of their packets that carry IOAM data fields.</t>

        <t>Namespace identifiers allow devices which are IOAM capable to
        determine:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>whether IOAM-Option-Type(s) need to be processed by a device:
            If the Namespace-ID contained in a packet does not match any
            Namespace-ID the node is configured to operate on, then the node
            MUST NOT change the contents of the IOAM-Data-Fields.</t>

            <t>which IOAM-Option-Type needs to be processed/updated in case
            there are multiple IOAM-Option-Types present in the packet.
            Multiple IOAM-Option-Types can be present in a packet in case of
            overlapping IOAM-Domains or in case of a layered IOAM
            deployment.</t>

            <t>whether IOAM-Option-Type(s) have to be removed from the packet,
            e.g., at a domain edge or domain boundary.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>IOAM-Namespaces support several different uses:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>IOAM-Namespaces can be used by an operator to distinguish
            different IOAM-domains. Devices at edges of an IOAM-domain 
            can filter
            on Namespace-IDs to provide for proper IOAM-domain isolation.</t>

            <t>IOAM-Namespaces provide additional context for IOAM-Data-Fields
			and thus can be used to ensure that IOAM-Data-Fields 
                    are unique and 
			are interpreted properly by management stations or network 
			controllers.  The node identifier field (node_id, see 
			below) does not need to be unique in a deployment. 
                    This could be the case if an operator wishes to use
                    different node identifiers for different 
			IOAM layers, even within the same device or node identifiers 
			might not be unique for other organizational reasons, 
                    such as after a merger of two formerly 
                    separated organizations. The Namespace-ID can be used as
                    a context identifier, such that 
			the combination of node_id and Namespace-ID will 
                    always be unique.</t>
            <t>
            Similarly, IOAM-Namespaces can be used to define how certain
            IOAM-Data-Fields are interpreted: IOAM offers three different
            timestamp format options. The Namespace-ID can be used to
            determine the timestamp format. IOAM-Data-Fields (e.g., buffer
            occupancy) which do not have a unit associated are to be
            interpreted within the context of a IOAM-Namespace.</t>

            <t>IOAM-Namespaces can be used to identify different sets of
            devices (e.g., different types of devices) in a deployment: If an
            operator desires to insert different IOAM-Data-Fields based on the
            device, the devices could be grouped into multiple
            IOAM-Namespaces. This could be due to the fact that the IOAM
            feature set differs between different sets of devices, or it could
            be for reasons of optimized space usage in the packet header. It
            could also stem from hardware or operational limitations on the
            size of the trace data that can be added and processed, preventing
            collection of a full trace for a flow.</t>

                <t>By assigning different IOAM 
                Namespace-IDs to different sets of
                nodes or network partitions and using a separate instance of
                an IOAM-Option-Type for each Namespace-ID, a full trace for a
                flow could be collected and constructed via partial traces
                from each IOAM-Option-Type in each of the packets in the flow.
                Example: An operator could choose to group the devices of a
                domain into two IOAM-Namespaces, in a way that each
                IOAM-Namespace is represented by one of two IOAM-Option-Types
                in the packet. Each node would record data only for the
                IOAM-Namespace that it belongs to, ignoring the other
                IOAM-Option-Type with a IOAM-Namespace to which it doesn't
                belong. To retrieve a full view of the deployment, the
                captured IOAM-Data-Fields of the two IOAM-Namespaces need to
                be correlated.</t>

      </section>

      <section anchor="IOAM_tracing_option" title="IOAM Trace Option-Types">
        <t> In a
        typical deployment, all nodes in an IOAM-Domain would participate in
        IOAM and thus be IOAM transit nodes, IOAM encapsulating or IOAM
        decapsulating nodes. If not all nodes within a domain support IOAM
        functionality as defined in this document, IOAM tracing information
        (i.e., node data, see below) can only be collected on those nodes
        which support IOAM functionality as defined in this document. Nodes
        which do not support IOAM functionality as defined in this document
        will forward the packet without any changes to the IOAM-Data-Fields.
        The maximum number of hops and the minimum path MTU of the IOAM-domain
        is assumed to be known. An overflow indicator (O-bit) is defined
	as one of the ways to deal with situations where the PMTU
	was underestimated, i.e., where the number of hops which
	are IOAM capable exceeds the available space in the packet.</t>

        <t>To optimize hardware and software implementations, IOAM tracing is
        defined as two separate options. A deployment can choose to configure 
		and support one or both of the following options.</t>

        <t><list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="Pre-allocated Trace-Option:">This trace option is
            defined as a container of node data fields (see below) with
            pre-allocated space for each node to populate its information.
            This option is useful for implementations where it is efficient to
            allocate the space once and index into the array to populate the
            data during transit (e.g., software forwarders often fall into
            this class). The IOAM encapsulating node allocates space for
            Pre-allocated Trace Option-Type in the packet and sets
            corresponding fields in this IOAM-Option-Type. The IOAM
            encapsulating node allocates an array which is used to store
            operational data retrieved from every node while the packet
            traverses the domain. IOAM transit nodes update the content of the
            array, and possibly update the checksums of outer headers. A
            pointer which is part of the IOAM trace data, points to the next
            empty slot in the array. An IOAM transit node that updates the
            content of the pre-allocated option also updates the value of the
            pointer, which specifies where the next IOAM transit node fills in
            its data. The "node data list" array (see below) in the packet is
            populated iteratively as the packet traverses the network,
            starting with the last entry of the array, i.e., "node data list
            [n]" is the first entry to be populated, "node data list [n-1]" is
            the second one, etc.</t>

            <t hangText="Incremental Trace-Option:">This trace option is
            defined as a container of node data fields where each node
            allocates and pushes its node data immediately following the
            option header. This type of trace recording is useful for some of
            the hardware implementations as it eliminates the need for the
            transit network elements to read the full array in the option and
            allows for arbitrarily long packets as the MTU allows. The IOAM
            encapsulating node allocates space for the Incremental Trace
            Option-Type. Based on operational state and configuration, the
            IOAM encapsulating node sets the fields in the Option-Type that
            control what IOAM-Data-Fields have to be collected and how large
            the node data list can grow. IOAM transit nodes push their node
			data to the node data list subject to any protocol constraints of 
			the encapsulating layer. They then decrease the remaining length
			available to subsequent nodes and adjust the lengths and possibly
			checksums in outer headers.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>IOAM encapsulating nodes and IOAM decapsulating nodes which support
        tracing MUST support both Trace-Option-Types. For IOAM transit nodes it
        is sufficient to support one of the Trace-Option-Types.  
        In the event that both options are utilized in a deployment 
        at the same time, the Incremental Trace-Option MUST be placed
        before the Pre-allocated Trace-Option. Deployments which mix devices
        with either the Incremental Trace-Option or the Pre-allocated
        Trace-Option could result in both Option-Types being present in a
        packet. Given that the operator knows which equipment is deployed in a
        particular IOAM-domain, the operator will decide by means of 
		configuration which type(s) of trace options will be used for a 
		particular domain.</t>

        <t>Every node data entry holds information for a particular IOAM
        transit node that is traversed by a packet. The IOAM decapsulating
        node removes the IOAM-Option-Type(s) and processes and/or exports the
        associated data. Like all IOAM-Data-Fields, the IOAM-Data-Fields of
        the IOAM-Trace-Option-Types are defined in the context of an
        IOAM-Namespace.</t>

        <t>IOAM tracing can collect the following types of information:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>Identification of the IOAM node. An IOAM node identifier can
            match to a device identifier or a particular control point or
            subsystem within a device.</t>

            <t>Identification of the interface that a packet was received on,
            i.e., ingress interface.</t>

            <t>Identification of the interface that a packet was sent out on,
            i.e., egress interface.</t>

            <t>Time of day when the packet was processed by the node as well
            as the transit delay. Different definitions of processing time are
            feasible and expected, though it is important that all devices of
            an IOAM-domain follow the same definition.</t>

            <t>Generic data: Format-free information where syntax and semantic
            of the information is defined by the operator in a specific
            deployment. For a specific IOAM-Namespace, all IOAM nodes have to
            interpret the generic data the same way. Examples for generic IOAM
            data include geo-location information (location of the node at the
            time the packet was processed), buffer queue fill level or cache
            fill level at the time the packet was processed, or even a battery
            charge level.</t>

            <t>Information to detect whether IOAM trace data was added at
            every hop or whether certain hops in the domain weren't IOAM
            transit nodes.</t>
          </list></t>
		  
		  <t>It should be noted that the semantics of some of the node data 
		  fields that are defined below, such as the queue depth and buffer 
		  occupancy, are implementation specific. This approach is intended 
		  to allow IOAM nodes with various different architectures.</t>

          <t>The IOAM Pre-allocated Trace-Option and the IOAM Incremental
          Trace-Option have similar formats. Except where noted below, the

          Both Trace-Options consist of a fixed size "trace option header" and
          a variable data space to store gathered data, the "node data list".

          <t>Some IOAM-Data-Fields defined below, such as interface
          identifiers or IOAM-Namespace specific data, are defined in both
          "short format" as well as "wide format". 
          The  use of "short format" or "wide format" is not mutually exclusive.
          A deployment could choose to leverage both. For example,
          ingress_if_id_(short format) could be an identifier for the physical
          interface, whereas ingress_if_id_(wide format) could be an
          identifier for a logical sub-interface of that physical
          interface.</t>

          <t>Data fields and associated data types for each of the
          IOAM-Data-Fields are specified in the following sections.
          The definition of IOAM-Data-Fields focuses on the syntax
          of the data-fields and avoids specifying the semantics
          where feasible. This is why no units are defined for
          data-fields like e.g., "buffer occupancy" or "queue depth".
          With this approach, nodes can supply the
          information in their native format and are not required
          to perform unit or format conversions. Systems that further
          process IOAM information, like e.g., a network management
          system are assumed to also handle unit conversions as part
          of their IOAM data-fields processing. The combination of a 
          particular data-field and the namespace-id provides for the context 
          to interpret the provided data appropriately.

                that this is a legitimate value that is valid for 1 second in

    <section title="Management and Deployment Considerations">
	    <t>This document defines the structure and use of IOAM data fields. 
	This document does not define the encapsulation of IOAM data fields into different protocols.
	Management and deployment aspects for IOAM have to be considered within the context of the
	protocol IOAM data fields are encapsulated into and as such, are out of scope for this document.
	For a discussion of IOAM deployment, please also refer to
	<xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-deployment"/>, which outlines a framework for IOAM deployment
       	and provides best current practices.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>As discussed in <xref target="RFC7276"/>, a successful attack on an
      OAM protocol in general, and specifically on IOAM, can prevent the
      detection of failures or anomalies, or create a false illusion of
      nonexistent ones. In particular, these threats are applicable by
      compromising the integrity of IOAM data, either by maliciously modifying
      IOAM options in transit, or by injecting packets with maliciously
      generated IOAM options. All nodes in the path of a IOAM carrying 
      packet can perform such an attack.
      </t>

      <t>The Proof of Transit Option-Type (see <xref
      target="IOAM_proof_of_transit_option"/>) is used for verifying the path
      of data packets, i.e., proving that packets transited through a defined set of nodes.</t>

      <t>In case an attacker gains access to several nodes in a network
      	and would be able to change the system software of these nodes,
        IOAM data fields could be misused and repurposed for a use
        different from what is specified in this document. 
        One type of misuse is the implementation of a covert channel between
      	network nodes.
      </t>

      <t>From a confidentiality perspective, although IOAM options are not expected to
      contain user data, they can be used for network reconnaissance, allowing
      attackers to collect information about network paths, performance, queue
      states, buffer occupancy and other information. Moreover, if IOAM data
      leaks from the IOAM-domain it could enable reconnaissance beyond the scope
      of the IOAM-domain. One possible application of such reconnaissance is 
      to gauge the effectiveness of an ongoing attack, e.g., 
      if buffers and queues are overflowing. </t>



      <t>IOAM can be used as a means for implementing Denial of Service (DoS)
      attacks, or for amplifying them. For example, a malicious attacker can
      add an IOAM header to packets in order to consume the resources of
      network devices that take part in IOAM or entities that receive, collect
      or analyze the IOAM data. Another example is a packet length attack, in
      which an attacker pushes headers associated with IOAM Option-Types into
      data packets, causing these packets to be increased beyond the MTU size,
      resulting in fragmentation or in packet drops. In case POT is used,
      an attacker could corrupt the POT data fields in the packet, resulting
      in a verification failure of the POT data, even if the packet followed
      the correct path.</t>

      <t>Since IOAM options can include timestamps, if network devices use
      synchronization protocols then any attack on the time protocol <xref
      target="RFC7384"/> can compromise the integrity of the timestamp-related
      data fields.</t>

      <t>At the management plane, attacks can be set up by misconfiguring
      or by maliciously configuring IOAM-enabled nodes in a way that enables
      other attacks. IOAM configuration should only managed by 
      authorized processes or users. </t>

      <t>IETF protocols require features to ensure their security. While IOAM data fields don't represent a protocol by themselves, the IOAM data fields add to the protocol that the IOAM data fields are encapsulated into. Any specification that defines how IOAM data fields carried in an encapsulating protocol MUST provide for a mechanism for cryptographic integrity protection of the IOAM data fields. Cryptographic integrity protection could be either achieved through a mechanism of the encapsulating protocol or it could incorporate the mechanisms specified in <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data-integrity"/>. </t>

      <t>The current document does not define a specific IOAM encapsulation.
      It has to be noted that some IOAM encapsulation types can introduce
      specific security considerations. A specification that defines an IOAM
      encapsulation is expected to address the respective
      encapsulation-specific security considerations.</t>

      <t>Notably, IOAM is expected to be deployed in limited domains, 
      	thus confining the potential attack vectors to within
      the limited domain. A limited administrative domain provides the
      operator with the means to select, monitor, and control the access of
      all the network devices, making these devices trusted by the operator.
      Indeed, in order to limit the scope of threats mentioned above to within
      the current limited domain the network operator is expected to enforce
      policies that prevent IOAM traffic from leaking outside of the IOAM
      domain, and prevent IOAM data from outside the domain to be processed
      and used within the domain.</t>
   
      <t>This document does not define the data contents of custom fields 
      like "Opaque State Snapshot" and "namespace specific data" IOAM
      data fields. These custom data fields will have security 
      considerations corresponding to their defined data contents 
	      that need to be described where those formats are defined.</t>

	<t>IOAM deployments which leverage both IOAM Trace Option-Types, i.e.,
	the Pre-allocated Trace Option-Type and Incremental Trace Option-Type
       can suffer from incomplete visibility if the information gathered via
       the two Trace Option-Types is not correlated and aggregated 
       appropriately. If IOAM transit nodes leverage the IOAM data fields
       in the packet for further actions or insights, 
       then IOAM transit nodes which only support one IOAM 
       Trace Option-Type in an IOAM deployment which leverages both Trace
       Option-Types, have limited visibility and thus can draw inappropriate
       conclusions or take wrong actions.
       </t>


      <t>The security considerations of a system that deploys IOAM, much like
      any system, has to be reviewed on a per-deployment-scenario basis, based
      on a systems-specific threat analysis, which can lead to specific
      security solutions that are beyond the scope of the current document.
	  Specifically, in an IOAM deployment that is not confined to a single
	  LAN, but spans multiple inter-connected sites (for example, using an
	  overlay network), the inter-site links can be secured (e.g., by IPsec)
	  in order to avoid external threats.</t>

      <t>IOAM deployment considerations, including approaches to mitigate the above
	      discussed threads and potential attacks are outside the scope of this 
	      document. IOAM deployment considerations are discussed in 
	      <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-deployment"/>.

    <!-- References split into informative and normative -->

    <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
     1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
     2. simply use a PI "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here
        (for I-Ds: include="reference.I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis.xml")

     Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
     If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
     directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
     with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
     filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->
