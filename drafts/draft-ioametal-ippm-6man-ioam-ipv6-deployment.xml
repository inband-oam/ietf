    <section anchor="v6_requirement"
             title="Considerations for IOAM deployment in IPv6 networks">
      <t>IOAM deployment in an IPv6 network should take the following
      considerations and requirements into account:<list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="C1">It is desirable that the addition of IOAM data
          fields neither changes the way routers forward the packets, nor the
          forwarding decision the routers takes. The packet with the added OAM
          information should follow the same path within the domain that the
          same packet without the OAM information would follow within the
          domain even in the presence of ECMP. Such a behavior is particularly
          interesting for deployments where IOAM data fields are only added
          "on-demand", e.g. to provide further insights in case of undesired
          network behavior for certain flows. Implementations of IOAM should
          ensure that ECMP behavior for packets with and without IOAM data
          fields is the same.</t>

          <t hangText="C2">Given that IOAM data fields increase the total size
          of the packet, the packet size could exceed the PMTU. In particular,
          the incremental trace IOAM HbH Option, which is proposed to support
          hardware implementations of IOAM, changes Option Data Length
          en-route. Operators of an IOAM domain are to ensure that the
          addition of OAM information does not lead to fragmentation of the
          packet. Careful control of the MTU in a network is one of the
          reasons why IOAM is considered a domain specific feature, see also
          <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data"/>. In addition, the PMTU
          tolerance range in the IOAM domain should be identified (e.g.
          through configuration) and IOAM encapsulation operations and/or IOAM
          data field insertion (in case of incremental tracing) should not be
          performed if it exceeds the packet size beyond PMTU.</t>

          <t hangText="C3">Packets with IOAM data or associated ICMP errors,
          should not arrive at destinations which have no knowledge of IOAM.
          Consider using IOAM in a transit network: Misleading ICMP errors due
          to addition and/or presence of OAM data in the packet can confuse a
          source of the packet that did not insert the OAM information.</t>

          <t hangText="C4">OAM data leaks may affect the forwarding behavior
          and state of network elements outside an IOAM domain. Build a
          mechanism to prevent data leaks or be able to assure that upon leak
          network elements outside the domain are not affected i.e continue to
          process other valid packets.</t>

          <t hangText="C5">Source OAM domain that inserted and leaked OAM data
          must be easy to identify for purpose of troubleshooting. For e.g. It
          very time consuming to troubleshoot source that inserted the EH but
          didn't remove when the packet traverses across AS (you have to walk
          the AS path, contacting each operator, asking them to verify their
          config, get packet captures etc.), and all the while you may have a
          number of angry customers/end-users.</t>

          <t hangText="C6">Compliance with <xref target="RFC8200"/> would
          require OAM data to be encapsulated instead of header/option
          insertion into in-flight packets.</t>
        </list></t>
    </section>

    <section title="IOAM domains bounded by hosts">
      <t>For deployments where the IOAM domain is bounded by hosts, hosts will
      perform the operation of IOAM data field encapsulation and
      decapsulation. IOAM data is carried in IPv6 packets as Hop-by-Hop or
      Destination options, see <xref
      target="I-D.ioametal-ippm-6man-ioam-ipv6-options"/>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="IOAM domains bounded by network devices ">
      <t>For deployments where the IOAM domain is bounded by network devices,
      network devices such as routers form the edge of an IOAM domain. Network
      devices will perform the operation of IOAM data field encapsulation and
      decapsulation.</t>

      <section title="Deployment options">
        <t>This section lists out possible deployment options that can be
        employed to meet the requirements listed in <xref
        target="v6_requirement"/>.</t>

        <section title="IPv6-in-IPv6 encapsulation">
          <t>Leverage an IPv6-in-IPv6 approach: Preserve the original IP
          packet and add an IPv6 header including IOAM data fields in an
          extension header in front of it, to forward traffic within and
          across the IOAM domain. The overlay network formed by the additional
          IPv6 header with the IOAM data fields included in an extension
          header is referred to as IOAM Overlay Network (ION) in this
          document. <list style="numbers">
              <t>Perform an IPv6-in-IPv6 approach. The source address of the
              outer IPv6 header is that of the IOAM encapsulating node. The
              destination address of the outer IPv6 header is the same as the
              inner IPv6 destination address, i.e. the destination address of
              the packet does not change.</t>

              <t>To simplify debugging in case of leaked IOAM data fields in
              packets, consider a new IOAM E2E destination option to identify
              the Source IOAM domain (AS, v6 prefix). Insert this option into
              the IOAM destination options EH attached to the outer IPv6
              header. This additional information would allow for easy
              identification of an AS operator that is the source of packets
              with leaked IOAM information.</t>

              <t>All the IOAM options are defined with type "00 - skip over
              this option and continue processing the header. So presence of
              the options must not cause packet drop in the network elements
              that do not understand the option. In addition <xref
              target="I-D.ietf-6man-hbh-header-handling"/> should be
              considered.</t>
            </list></t>
        </section>

        <section title="IP-in-IPv6 encapsulation with ULA">
          <t>The "IP-in-IPv6 encapsulation with ULA" approach can be used to
          apply IOAM to an IPv6 as well as an IPv4 network. In addition, it
          fulfills requirement C4 (avoid leaks) by using ULA for the ION.
          Similar to the IPv6-in-IPv6 encapsulation approach above, the
          original IP packet is preserved. An IPv6 header including IOAM data
          fields in an extension header is added in front of it, to forward
          traffic within and across the IOAM domain. IPv6 addresses for the
          ION, i.e. the outer IPv6 addresses are assigned from the ULA space.
          Addressing and routing in the ION are to be configured so that the
          IP-in-IPv6 encapsulated packets follow the same path as the
          original, non-encapsulated packet would have taken. Transit across
          the ION could leverage the transit approach for traffic between BGP
          border routers, as described in RFC1772, "A.2.3 Encapsulation".</t>
