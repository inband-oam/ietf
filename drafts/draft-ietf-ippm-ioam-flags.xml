      <t>The Loopback flag is used to request that each transit device along
      the path loops back a truncated copy of the data packet to the sender.
      Loopback allows an IOAM encapsulating node to trace the path to a given
      destination, and to receive per-hop data about both the forward and the
      return path. Loopback is intended to provide an accelerated alternative
      to Traceroute, that allows the encapsulating node to receive responses
      from multiple transit nodes along the path in less then one
      round-trip-time, and by sending a single packet.</t>

      <t>As illustrated in <xref target="LoopbackFig"/>, an IOAM encapsulating
      node can push an IOAM encapsulation that includes the Loopback flag onto
      some or all of the packets it forwards, using one of the IOAM
      encapsulation types, e.g., <xref target="I-D.ietf-sfc-ioam-nsh"/>, or
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-ipv6-options"/>.
	  The IOAM transit node and the
      decapsulating node both creates copies of the packet and loop them back
      to the encapsulating node. The decapsulating node also terminates the
      IOAM encapsulation, and then forwards the packet towards the
      destination. The two IOAM looped back copies are terminated by the
      encapsulating node.</t>

      <t>Loopback can be used only if a return path from transit nodes and
      destination nodes towards the source (encapsulating node) exists.
      Specifically, loopback is only applicable in encapsulations in which the
      identity of the encapsulating node is available in the encapsulation
      header. If an encapsulating node receives a looped back packet that was
      not originated from the current encapsulating node, the packet is
      dropped.</t>

      <section title="Loopback: Encapsulating Node Functionality">
        <t>The encapsulating node either generates synthetic packets with an
        IOAM trace option that has the Loopback flag set, or sets the loopack
        flag in a subset of the in-transit data packets. Loopback is used
        either proactively or on-demand, i.e., when a failure is detected. The
        encapsulating node also needs to ensure that sufficient space is
        available in the IOAM header for loopback operation, which includes
        transit nodes adding trace data on the original path and then again on
        the return path.</t>

        <t>An IOAM trace option that has the Loopback flag set MUST have the
        value '1' in the most significant bit of IOAM-Trace-Type, and '0' in
        the rest of the bits of IOAM-Trace-Type. Thus, every transit node that
        processes this trace option only adds a single data field, which is
        the Hop_Lim and node_id data field. A transit node that receives a
        packet with an IOAM trace option that has the Loopback flag set and
        the IOAM-Trace-Type is not equal to '1' in the most significant bit
        and '0' in the rest of the bits, MUST NOT loop back a copy of the
        packet. The reason for allowing only a single data field per hop is to
        minimize the impact of amplification attacks.</t>

        <t>IOAM encapsulating nodes MUST NOT push an IOAM encapsulation with
        the Loopback flag onto data packets that already include an IOAM
        encapsulation. This requirement is intended to prevent IOAM Loopback
        nesting, where looped back packets may be subject to loopback in a
        nested IOAM domain.</t>

        <section anchor="SelectSec" title="Loopback Packet Selection">
          <t>If an IOAM encapsulating node incorporates the Loopback flag into
          all the traffic it forwards it may lead to an excessive amount of
          looped back packets, which may overload the network and the
          encapsulating node. Therefore, an IOAM encapsulating node that
          supports the Loopback flag MUST support the ability to incorporate
          the Loopback flag selectively into a subset of the packets that are
          forwarded by it.</t>

          <t>Various methods of packet selection and sampling have been
          previously defined, such as <xref target="RFC7014"/> and <xref
          target="RFC5475"/>. Similar techniques can be applied by an IOAM
          encapsulating node to apply Loopback to a subset of the forwarded
          traffic.</t>

          <t>The subset of traffic that is forwarded or transmitted with a
          Loopback flag SHOULD NOT exceed 1/N of the interface capacity on any
          of the IOAM encapsulating node's interfaces. This requirement
          applies to the total traffic that incorporates a Loopback flag,
          including traffic that is forwarded by the IOAM encapsulating node
          and probe packets that are generated by the IOAM encapsulating node.
          In this context N is a parameter that can be configurable by network
          operators. If there is an upper bound, M, on the number of IOAM
          transit nodes in any path in the network, then configuring N such that
          N &gt;&gt; M (i.e., N is much greater than M) is RECOMMENDED. 
		  The rationale is that a packet that
          includes the Loopback flag triggers a looped back packet from each
          IOAM transit node along the path for a total of M looped back
          packets. Thus, if N &gt;&gt; M then the number of looped back
          packets is significantly lower than the number of data packets
          forwarded by the IOAM encapsulating node. It is RECOMMENDED
		  that the default value of N satisfies N&gt;100, to be used
		  in the absence of explicit operator configuration or
		  if there is no prior knowledge about the network topology or size.</t>

          <t>An IOAM domain in which the Loopback flag is used MUST be 
		  configured such that there is expected to be a return path from each 
		  of the IOAM transit and IOAM decapsulating nodes; if this expectation 
		  does not apply, or if the encapsulating node's identity is not
          available in the encapsulation header, then configuration MUST NOT 
		  enable the Loopback flag to be set.</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section anchor="ReceiveSec" title="Receiving and Processing Loopback">
        <t>A Loopback flag that is set indicates to the transit nodes
        processing this option that they are to create a copy of the received
        packet and send the copy back to the source of the packet. In this
        context the source is the IOAM encapsulating node, and it is assumed
        that the source address is available in the encapsulation header.
        Thus, the source address of the original packet is used as the
        destination address in the copied packet. If IOAM is used over an
		encapsulation that does not include the address of the encapsulating
		node, then
        the transit/decapsulating node does not loop back a copy of the
        original packet. The address of the node performing the copy operation
        is used as the source address; the specific method of source address
		assignment is encapsulation specific, e.g., if an IPv6
		encapsulation is used, then the source address can be assigned as
		specified in <xref target="RFC6724"/>. 
		The copy is also truncated, i.e., any
        payload that resides after the IOAM option(s) is removed before
        transmitting the looped back packet back towards the encapsulating
        node. Creating the copy that is looped back, and specifically the 
		truncation, may require some encapsulation-specific updates 
		in the encapsulation header.
		The original packet continues towards its destination. The L-bit
        MUST be cleared in the copy of the packet that a node sends back
        towards the source.</t>

        <t>An IOAM node that supports the reception and processing of the
        Loopback flag MUST support the ability to limit the rate of the looped
        back packets. The rate of looped back packets SHOULD be limited so
        that the number of looped back packets is significantly lower than the
        number of packets that are forwarded by the device. The looped back
        data rate SHOULD NOT exceed 1/N of the interface capacity on any of
        the IOAM node's interfaces. Using N&gt;100 is RECOMMENDED. Depending
        on the IOAM node's architecture considerations, the loopback response
        rate may be limited to a lower number in order to avoid overloading
        the IOAM node.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Loopback on the Return Path">
        <t>On its way back towards the source, the copied packet is processed
        like any other packet with IOAM information, including adding
        requested data at each transit node (assuming there is sufficient
        space).</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Terminating a Looped Back Packet">
        <t>Once the return packet reaches the IOAM domain boundary, IOAM
        decapsulation occurs as with any other packet containing IOAM
        information. Note that the looped back packet does not have the L-bit
        set. The IOAM encapsulating node that initiated the original loopback
        packet recognizes a received packet as an IOAM looped-back packet by
        checking the Node ID in the Hop_Lim/node_id field that corresponds to
        the first hop. If the Node ID and IOAM-Namespace match the current
        IOAM node, it indicates that this is a looped back packet that was
        initiated by the current IOAM node, and processed accordingly. If
        there is no match in the Node ID, the packet is processed like a
        conventional IOAM-encapsulated packet.</t>

        <t>Note that an IOAM encapsulating node may either be an endpoint
        (such as an IPv6 host), or a switch/router that pushes a tunnel
        encapsulation onto data packets. In both cases, the functionality that
        was described above avoids IOAM data leaks from the IOAM domain.
        Specifically, if an IOAM looped-back packet reaches an IOAM boundary
        node that is not the IOAM node that initiated the loopback, the node
        does not process the packet as a loopback; the IOAM encapsulation is
        removed, preventing IOAM information from
        leaking out from the IOAM domain, and since the packet does not have any payload it is
        terminated.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="UseCaseSec" title="Active Measurement with IOAM">
      <t>Active measurement methods <xref target="RFC7799"/> make use of
      synthetically generated packets in order to facilitate measurement. This
      section presents use cases of active measurement using the IOAM Active
      flag.</t>

      <t>The Active flag indicates that a packet is used for active
      measurement. An IOAM decapsulating node that receives a packet with the
      Active flag set in one of its Trace options must terminate the packet.
      The Active flag is intended to simplify the implementation of
      decapsulating nodes by indicating that the packet should not be
      forwarded further. It is not intended as a replacement for existing
      active OAM protocols, which may run in higher layers and make use of the
      Active flag.</t>

      <t>An example of an IOAM deployment scenario is illustrated in <xref
      target="NetworkFig"/>. The figure depicts two endpoints, a source and a
      destination. The data traffic from the source to the destination is
      forwarded through a set of network devices, including an IOAM
      encapsulating node, which incorporates one or more IOAM options, a
      decapsulating node, which removes the IOAM options, optionally one or
      more transit nodes. The IOAM options are encapsulated in one of the IOAM
      encapsulation types, e.g., <xref target="I-D.ietf-sfc-ioam-nsh"/>, or
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-ipv6-options"/>.</t>

          between the source and destination, traversing the IOAM domain.
          Since the probe packets are sent between the endpoints, these
          packets are treated as data packets by the IOAM domain, and do not
          require special treatment at the IOAM layer. Specifically, the
          Active flag is not used in this case, and the IOAM layer does not
		  need to
          be aware that an active measurement mechanism is used at a higher
          layer.</t>

          <t>IOAM active measurement using probe packets within the IOAM
          domain: probe packets are generated and transmitted by the IOAM
          encapsulating node, and are expected to be terminated by the
          decapsulating node. IOAM data related to probe packets may be
          exported by one or more nodes along its path, by an exporting
          protocol that is outside the scope of this document (e.g., <xref
          target="I-D.spiegel-ippm-ioam-rawexport"/>). Probe packets include a
          Trace Option which has its Active flag set, indicating that the
          decapsulating node must terminate them. The specification of
		  these probe packets and the processing of these packets by the 
		  encapsulating and decapsulating nodes is outside the scope of
		  this document.</t>

          <t>IOAM active measurement using replicated data packets: probe
          packets are created by the encapsulating node by selecting some or
          all of the en route data packets and replicating them. A selected
          data packet, and its (possibly truncated) copy is
          forwarded with one or more IOAM options, while the original packet
          is forwarded normally, without IOAM options. To the extent possible,
          the original data packet and its replica are forwarded through the
          same path. The replica includes a Trace Option that has its Active
          flag set, indicating that the decapsulating node should terminate
          it. The current document defines the role of the Active flag in
          allowing the decapsulating node to terminate the packet, but the
          replication functionality and the functionality of the decapsulating
		  node in this context is outside the scope of this document.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>If the volume of traffic that incorporates the Active flag is large,
      it may overload the network and the IOAM node(s) that process the active
      measurement packet. Thus, the rate of the traffic that includes the
      Active flag SHOULD NOT exceed 1/N of the interface capacity on any
      of the IOAM node's interfaces. Using N&gt;100 is RECOMMENDED. Depending
      on the IOAM node's architecture considerations, the rate of
      Active-enabled IOAM packets may be limited to a lower number in order to
      avoid overloading the IOAM node.</t>

    <section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>IANA is requested to allocate the following bits in the "IOAM Trace
      Flags Registry" as follows:</t>

      <t><list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="Bit 1">"Loopback" (L-bit)</t>

          <t hangText="Bit 2">"Active" (A-bit)</t>
        </list></t>

	  <t>The "Reference" specified in the registry for both bits should
	  be the current document.</t>
	  
      <t>Note that bit 0 is the most significant bit in the Flags
      Registry. This bit was allocated by <xref target="RFC9197"/> as the 
	  'Overflow' bit.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Performance" title="Performance Considerations">
      <t>Each of the flags that are defined in this document may have
      performance implications. When using the loopback mechanism a copy of
      the data packet is sent back to the sender, thus generating more traffic
      than originally sent by the endpoints. Using active measurement with the
      Active flag requires the use of synthetic (overhead) traffic.</t>

      <t>Each of the mechanisms that use the flags above has a cost in terms
      of the network bandwidth, and may potentially load the node that
      analyzes the data. Therefore, it MUST be possible to use each of the
      mechanisms on a subset of the data traffic; an encapsulating node needs
      to be able to set the Loopback and Active flag selectively, in a way
      that considers the effect on the network performance, as further
      discussed in <xref target="SelectSec"/> and <xref
      target="UseCaseSec"/>.</t>

      <t>Transit and decapsulating nodes that support Loopback need to be able
      to limit the looped back packets (<xref target="ReceiveSec"/>) so as to
      ensure that the mechanisms are used at a rate that does not
      significantly affect the network bandwidth, and does not overload the
      source node in the case of loopback.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The security considerations of IOAM in general are discussed in <xref
      target="RFC9197"/>. Specifically, an attacker may try to use the
      functionality that is defined in this document to attack the
      network.</t>

      <t>IOAM is assumed to be deployed in a restricted administrative domain,
      thus limiting the scope of the threats above and their effect. This is a
      fundamental assumption with respect to the security aspects of IOAM, as
      further discussed in <xref target="RFC9197"/>. However, even given this
      limited scope, security threats should still be considered and
      mitigated. Specifically, an attacker may attempt to overload network
      devices by injecting synthetic packets that include an IOAM Trace Option
      with one or more of the flags defined in this document. Similarly, an
      on-path attacker may maliciously set one or more of the flags of transit
      packets.</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Loopback flag: an attacker that sets this flag, either in
          synthetic packets or transit packet, can potentially cause an
          amplification, since each device along the path creates a copy of
          the data packet and sends it back to the source. The attacker can
          potentially leverage the Loopback flag for a Distributed Denial of
          Service (DDoS) attack, as multiple devices send looped-back copies
          of a packet to a single victim.</t>

          <t>Active flag: the impact of synthetic packets with the Active flag
          is no worse than synthetic data packets in which the Active flag is
          not set. By setting the Active flag in en route packets an attacker
          can prevent these packets from reaching their destination, since the
          packet is terminated by the decapsulating device; however, note that
          an on-path attacker may achieve the same goal by changing the
          destination address of a packet. Another potential threat is
          amplification; if an attacker causes transit switches to replicate
          more packets than they are intended to replicate, either by setting
          the Active flag or by sending synthetic packets, then traffic is
          amplified, causing bandwidth degredation. As mentioned in <xref
          target="UseCaseSec"/>, the specification of the replication
          mechanism is not within the scope of this document. A specification
          that defines the replication functionality should also address the
          security aspects of this mechanism.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Some of the security threats that were discussed in this document may
      be worse in a wide area network in which there are nested IOAM domains.
      For example, if there are two nested IOAM domains that use loopback,
      then a looped-back copy in the outer IOAM domain may be forwarded
      through another (inner) IOAM domain and may be subject to loopback in
      that (inner) IOAM domain, causing the amplification to be worse than in
      the conventional case.</t>

      <t>In order to mitigate the performance-related attacks described above,
      as described in <xref target="Performance"/> it should be possible for
      IOAM-enabled devices to selectively apply the mechanisms that use the
      flags defined in this document to a subset of the traffic, and to limit
      the performance of synthetically generated packets to a configurable
      rate. Specifically, IOAM nodes should be able to:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Limit the rate of IOAM packets with the Loopback flag (IOAM
          encapsulating nodes), as discussed in <xref
          target="SelectSec"/>.</t>

          <t>Limit the rate of looped back packets (IOAM transit and
          decapsulating nodes), as discussed in <xref

          encapsulating nodes), as discussed in <xref

        </list></t>

      <t>As defined in <xref target="LoopbackSec"/>, transit nodes that
      process a packet with the Loopback flag only add a single data field,
      and truncate any payload that follows the IOAM option(s), thus
      significanly limiting the possible impact of an amplification
      attack.</t>
