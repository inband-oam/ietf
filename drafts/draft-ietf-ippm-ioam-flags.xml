    <section anchor="LoopbackSec" title="Loopback in IOAM">
      <t>Loopback is used for triggering each transit device along the path to
      loop back a copy of the data packet. Loopback allows an IOAM
      encapsulating node to trace the path to a given destination, and to
      receive per-hop data about both the forward and the return path.
      Loopback is intended to provide an accelerated alternative to
      Traceroute, that allows the encapsulating node to receive responses from
      multiple transit nodes along the path in less then one round-trip-time,
      and by sending a single packet.</t>

      <t>Loopback can be used only if a return path from transit nodes and
      destination nodes towards the source (encapsulating node) exists.
      Specifically, loopback is only applicable in encapsulations in which the
      identity of the encapsulating node is available in the encapsulation
      header. If an encapsulating node receives a looped back packet that was
      not originated from the current encapsulating node, the packet is
      dropped.</t>

      <t>The encapsulating node either generates synthetic packets with an
      IOAM trace option that has the loopback flag set, or sets the loopack
      flag in a subset of the in-transit data packets. Loopback is used either
      proactively or on-demand, i.e., when a failure is detected. The
      encapsulating node also needs to ensure that sufficient space is
      available in the IOAM header for loopback operation, which includes
      transit nodes adding trace data on the original path and then again on
      the return path. </t>

      <t>An IOAM trace option that has the loopback bit set MUST have the
      value '1' in the most significant bit of IOAM-Trace-Type, and '0' in the
      rest of the bits of IOAM-Trace-Type. Thus, every transit node that
      processes this trace option only adds a single data field, which is the
      Hop_Lim and node_id data field. The reason for allowing a single data
      field per hop is to minimize the impact of amplification attacks.</t>

      <t>A loopback bit that is set indicates to the transit nodes processing
      this option that they are to create a copy of the received packet and
      send the copy back to the source of the packet. In this context the
      source is the IOAM encapsulating node, and it is assumed that the source
      address is available in the encapsulation header. Thus, the source
      address of the original packet is used as the destination address in the
      copied packet. The address of the node performing the copy operation is
      used as the source address. The IOAM transit node pushes the required
      data field *after* creating the copy of the packet, in order to allow
      any egress-dependent information to be set based on the egress of the
      copy rather than the original packet. The copy is also truncated, i.e.,
      any payload that resides after the IOAM option(s) is removed before
      transmitting the looped back packet back towards the encapsulating node.
      The original packet continues towards its destination. The L-bit MUST be
      cleared in the copy of the packet that a node sends back towards the
      source. </t>

      <t>On its way back towards the source, the copied packet is processed
      like any other packet with IOAM information, including adding any
      requested data at each transit node (assuming there is sufficient
      space).</t>

      <t>Once the return packet reaches the IOAM domain boundary, IOAM
      decapsulation occurs as with any other packet containing IOAM
      information. Note that the looped back packet does not have the L-bit
      set. The IOAM encapsulating node that initiated the original loopback
      packet recognizes a received packet as an IOAM looped-back packet by
      checking the Node ID in the Hop_Lim/node_id field that corresponds to
      the first hop. If the Node ID matches the current IOAM node, it
      indicates that this is a looped back packet that was initiated by the
      current IOAM node, and processed accordingly. If there is no match in
      the Node ID, the packet is processed like a conventional
      IOAM-encapsulated packet. </t>

      <t>Note that an IOAM encapsulating node may either be an endpoint (such
      as an IPv6 host), or a switch/router that pushes a tunnel encapsulation
      onto data packets. In both cases, the functionality that was described
      above avoids IOAM data leaks from the IOAM domain. Specificallly, if an
      IOAM looped-back packet reaches an IOAM boundary node that is not the
      IOAM node that initiated the loopback, the node does not process the
      packet as a loopback; the IOAM encapsulation is removed, and since the
      packet does not have any payload it is terminated. In either case, when
      the packet reaches the IOAM boundary its IOAM encapsulation is removed,
      preventing IOAM information from leaking out from the IOAM domain.</t>

    <section anchor="UseCaseSec" title="Active Measurement with IOAM">
      <t>Active measurement methods <xref target="RFC7799"/> make use of
      synthetically generated packets in order to facilitate the measurement.
      This section presents use cases of active measurement using the IOAM
      Active flag.</t>

      <t>The active flag indicates that a packet is used for active
      measurement. An IOAM decapsulating node that receives a packet with the
      Active flag set in one of its Trace options must terminate the packet.
      The active flag is intended to simplify the implementation of
      decapsulating nodes by indicating that the packet should not be
      forwarded further. It is not intended as a replacement for existing
      active OAM protocols, which may run in higher layers and make use of the
      active flag.</t>

      <t>An example of an IOAM deployment scenario is illustrated in <xref
      target="NetworkFig"/>. The figure depicts two endpoints, a source and a
      destination. The data traffic from the source to the destination is
      forwarded through a set of network devices, including an IOAM
      encapsulating node, which incorporates one or more IOAM options, a
      decapsulating node, which removes the IOAM options, optionally one or
      more transit nodes. The IOAM options are encapsulated in one of the IOAM
      encapsulation types, e.g., <xref target="I-D.ietf-sfc-ioam-nsh"/>, or
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-ipv6-options"/>.</t>

      <t>This draft focuses on three possible use cases of active measurement
      using IOAM. These use cases are described using the example of <xref
      target="NetworkFig"/>.</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Endpoint active measurement: synthetic probe packets are sent
          between the source and destination, traversing the IOAM domain.
          Since the probe packets are sent between the endpoints, these
          packets are treated as data packets by the IOAM domain, and do not
          require special treatment at the IOAM layer. Specifically, the
          active flag is not used in this case, and the IOAM layer needs not
          be aware that an active measurement mechanism is used at a higher
          layer.</t>

          <t>IOAM active measurement using probe packets within the IOAM
          domain: probe packets are generated and transmitted by the IOAM
          encapsulating node, and are expected to be terminated by the
          decapsulating node. IOAM data related to probe packets may be
          exported by one or more nodes along its path, by an exporting
          protocol that is outside the scope of this document (e.g., <xref
          target="I-D.spiegel-ippm-ioam-rawexport"/>). Probe packets include a
          Trace Option which has its Active flag set, indicating that the
          decapsulating node must terminate them.</t>

          <t>IOAM active measurement using replicated data packets: probe
          packets are created by the encapsulating node by selecting some or
          all of the en route data packets and replicating them. A selected
          data packet that is replicated, and its (possibly truncated) copy is
          forwarded with one or more IOAM option, while the original packet is
          forwarded normally, without IOAM options. To the extent possible,
          the original data packet and its replica are forwarded through the
          same path. The replica includes a Trace Option that has its Active
          flag set, indicating that the decapsulating node should terminate
          it. It should be noted that the current document defines the role of
          the active flag in allowing the decapsulating node to terminate the
          packet, but the replication functionality in this context is outside
          the scope of this document.</t>
        </list></t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>IANA is requested to allocate the following bits in the "IOAM Trace
      Flags Registry" as follows:</t>

      <t><list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="Bit 1">"Loopback" (L-bit)</t>

          <t hangText="Bit 2">"Active" (A-bit)</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Note that bit 0 is the most significant bit in the Flags
      Registry.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Performance" title="Performance Considerations">
      <t>Each of the flags that are defined in this document may have
      performance implications. When using the loopback mechanism a copy of
      the data packet is sent back to the sender, thus generating more traffic
      than originally sent by the endpoints. Using active measurement with the
      active flag requires the use of synthetic (overhead) traffic.</t>

      <t>Each of the mechanisms that use the flags above has a cost in terms
      of the network bandwidth, and may potentially load the node that
      analyzes the data. Therefore, it MUST be possible to use each of the
      mechanisms on a subset of the data traffic; an encapsulating node needs
      to be able to set the Loopback and Active flag selectively, in a way
      that considers the effect on the network performance. Similarly, transit
      and decapsulating nodes need to be able to selectively loop back packets
      with the Loopback flag, and to selectively export packets. Specifically,
      rate limiting can be enabled so as to ensure that the mechanisms are
      used at a rate that does not significantly affect the network bandwidth,
      and does not overload the receiving entity (or the source node in the
      case of loopback).</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The security considerations of IOAM in general are discussed in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data"/>. Specifically, an attacker may try to
      use the functionality that is defined in this document to attack the
      network.</t>

      <t>An attacker may attempt to overload network devices by injecting
      synthetic packets that include an IOAM Trace Option with one or more of
      the flags defined in this document. Similarly, an on-path attacker may
      maliciously set one or more of the flags of transit packets.</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Loopback flag: an attacker that sets this flag, either in
          synthetic packets or transit packet, can potentially cause an
          amplification, since each device along the path creates a copy of
          the data packet and sends it back to the source. The attacker can
          potentially leverage the loopback flag for a Distributed Denial of
          Service (DDoS) attack, as multiple devices send looped-back copies
          of a packet to a single source.</t>

          <t>Active flag: the impact of synthetic packets with the active flag
          is no worse than synthetic data packets in which the Active flag is
          not set. By setting the active flag in en route packets an attacker
          can prevent these packets from reaching their destination, since the
          packet is terminated by the decapsulating device; however, note that
          an on-path attacker may achieve the same goal by changing the
          destination address of a packet. Another potential threat is
          amplification; if an attacker causes transit switches to replicate
          more packets than they are intended to replicate, either by setting
          the Active flag or by sending synthetic packets, then traffic is
          amplified, causing bandwidth degredation. As mentioned in <xref
          target="UseCaseSec"/>, the specification of the replication
          mechanism is not within the scope of this document. A specification
          that defines the replication functionality should also address the
          security aspects of this mechanism.</t>
        </list></t>

	  <t>Some of the security threats that were discussed in this document may
	  be worse in a wide area network in which there are nested IOAM
	  domains. For example, if there are two nested IOAM domains that use
	  loopback, then a looped-back copy in the outer IOAM domain may be
	  forwarded through another (inner) IOAM domain and may be subject to
	  loopback in that (inner) IOAM domain, causing the amplification to be
	  worse than in the conventional case.</t>

      <t>In order to mitigate the attacks described above, as described in
      <xref target="Performance"/> it should be possible for IOAM-enabled
      devices to selectively apply the mechanisms that use the flags defined
      in this document to a subset of the traffic, and to limit the
      performance of synthetically generated packets to a configurable rate;
      specifically, network devices should be able to limit the rate of: (i)
      looped-back traffic (at transit nodes), (ii) replicated active packets
      (at encapsulating nodes), (iii) packets that are exported to a collector
      (from either encapsulating nodes or transit nodes), and (iv)
      synthetically generated packets (at encapsulating nodes).</t>

      <t>Furthermore, as defined in <xref target="LoopbackSec"/>, transit
      nodes that process a packet with the Loopback flag only add a single
      data field, and truncate any payload that follows the IOAM option(s),
      thus significanly limiting the possible impact of an amplification
      attack.</t>

      <t>IOAM is assumed to be deployed in a restricted administrative domain,
      thus limiting the scope of the threats above and their affect. This is a
      fundamental assumtion with respect to the security aspects of IOAM, as
      further discussed in <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data"/>.</t>
