	<section anchor="LoopbackSec" title="Loopback in IOAM">
 	    <t>Loopback is used for triggering each transit device along
		the path to loop back a copy of the data packet. 
		Loopback allows an IOAM encapsulating node to trace the path to a 
		given destination, and to receive per-hop data about both the
		forward and the return path. Loopback is intended to provide an 
		accelerated alternative to Traceroute, that allows the encapsulating
		node to receive responses from multiple transit nodes along the path 
		in less then one round-trip-time.
		</t>

        <t>Loopback mode assumes that a return path from transit nodes
 	    and destination nodes towards the source (encapsulating node) exists.
		Specifically, loopback is only applicable in encapsulations in 
		which the identity of the encapsulating node is available in the
		encapsulation header. If an encapsulating node receives a looped 
		back packet that was not originated from the current encapsulating 
		node, the packet is dropped.
		</t>

		
		<t>The encapsulating node generates synthetic packets with an IOAM
		trace option that has the loopback flag set. These packets are
		generated either proactively or on-demand, i.e., when a failure is 
		detected. The encapsulating node also needs to ensure that
 	    sufficient space is available in the IOAM header for
 	    loopback operation, which includes transit nodes adding
 	    trace data on the original path and then again on the return
 	    path. An IOAM trace option that has the loopback bit set MUST have
		the value '1' in the most significant bit of IOAM-Trace-Type, and
		'0' in the rest of the bits of IOAM-Trace-Type. Thus, every 
		transit node that processes this trace option only adds a single 
		data field, which is the Hop_Lim and node_id data field. The 
		reason for allowing a single data field per hop is to minimize
		the impact of amplification attacks.</t>
		
		<t>A loopback bit that is set indicates to the transit
 	    nodes processing this option that they are to create a copy
 	    of the received packet and send the copy back to the source
 	    of the packet. The copy has its data fields added after being
 	    copied in order to allow any egress-dependent information to
 	    be set based on the egress of the copy rather than the
 	    original. The copy is also truncated, i.e., any payload that 
		resides after the IOAM option(s) is removed before transmitting the
		looped back packet back towards the encapsulating node.
		The original packet continues towards its
 	    destination. The source address of the original packet is
 	    used as the destination address in the copied packet. The
 	    address of the node performing the copy operation is used as
 	    the source address. The L-bit MUST be cleared in the copy of
 	    the packet that a node sends back towards the source. On its
 	    way back towards the source, the copied packet is processed
 	    like any other packet with IOAM information, including
 	    adding any requested data at each transit node (assuming
 	    there is sufficient space).</t>
		
		<t>Once the return packet reaches
 	    the IOAM domain boundary, IOAM decapsulation occurs as with
 	    any other packet containing IOAM information. Because any
 	    intermediate node receiving such a packet would not know how
 	    to process the original packet, and because there would be a
 	    risk of the original packet leaking past the initiator of
 	    the IOAM loopback, the initiator of an IOAM loopback MUST be
 	    the initiator of the packet. Once a loopback packet is
 	    received back at the initiator, it is a local matter how it
 	    is recognized as a loopback packet.</t>

    <section anchor="UseCaseSec" title="Active Measurement with IOAM">

	  <t>Active measurement methods <xref target="RFC7799"/> make use of 
	  synthetically generated packets in order to facilitate the measurement.
	  This section presents use cases of active measurement using the IOAM
	  Active flag.</t>

	  <t>The active flag indicates that a packet is used for active 
	  measurement. An IOAM decapsulating node that receives a packet with 
	  the Active flag set in one of its Trace options must terminate the 
	  packet.
	  The active flag is intended to simplify the implementation of 
	  decapsulating nodes by indicating that the packet should not be forwarded 
	  further. It is not intended as a replacement for existing active OAM
	  protocols, which may run in higher layers and make use of the active
	  flag.</t>

 	  <t>An example of an IOAM deployment scenario is illustrated in
	  <xref target="NetworkFig"></xref>. The figure depicts two endpoints,
	  a source and a destination. The data traffic from the source to the
	  destination is forwarded through a set of network devices, including
	  an IOAM encapsulating node, which incorporates one or more IOAM 
	  options, a decapsulating node, which removes the IOAM options, optionally
	  one or more transit nodes. The IOAM options are encapsulated in one
	  of the IOAM encapsulation types, e.g., 
	  <xref target="I-D.ietf-sfc-ioam-nsh"/>, or 
	  <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-ipv6-options"/>.</t>

	  <t>This draft focuses on three possible use cases of active measurement
	  using IOAM. These use cases are described using the example of 
	  <xref target="NetworkFig"></xref>.</t>
	  
	  
      <t><list style="symbols">
         <t>Endpoint active measurement: synthetic probe packets are sent 
		 between the source and destination, traversing the IOAM domain.
		 Since the probe packets are sent between the endpoints, these packets
		 are treated as data packets by the IOAM domain, and do not require
		 special treatment at the IOAM layer. Specifically, the active flag
		 is not used in this case, and the IOAM layer needs not be aware that
		 an active measurement mechanism is used at a higher layer.</t>

         <t>IOAM active measurement using probe packets within the IOAM domain: 
		 probe packets are generated and transmitted by the IOAM encapsulating 
		 node, and are expected to be terminated by the decapsulating node. 
		 IOAM data related to probe packets may be exported by one or more 
		 nodes along its path, by an exporting protocol that is outside the 
		 scope of this document (e.g., 
		 <xref target="I-D.spiegel-ippm-ioam-rawexport"/>). Probe 
		 packets include a Trace Option which has its Active flag set, 
		 indicating that the decapsulating node must terminate them.</t>

         <t>IOAM active measurement using replicated data packets: probe 
		 packets are created by the encapsulating node by selecting some or 
		 all of the en route data packets and replicating them. A selected data 
		 packet that is replicated, and its (possibly truncated) copy is 
		 forwarded with one or more IOAM option, while the original packet is
		 forwarded normally, without IOAM options. To the extent possible, the 
		 original data packet and its replica are forwarded through the same 
		 path. The replica includes a Trace Option that has its Active flag 
		 set, indicating that the decapsulating node should terminate it.
		 It should be noted that the current document defines the role of the
		 active flag in allowing the decapsulating node to terminate the 
		 packet, but the replication functionality in this context is outside
		 the scope of this document.

    <section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">
	
        <t>IANA is requested to allocate the following bits in the

			<t hangText="Bit 1">"Loopback" (L-bit)</t>
            <t hangText="Bit 2">"Active" (A-bit)</t>

		<t>Note that bit 0 is the most significant bit in the Flags Registry.

    </section>

    <section anchor="Performance" title="Performance Considerations">
      <t>Each of the flags that are defined in this document may have
	  performance implications. When using the loopback mechanism a copy of
	  the data packet is sent back to the sender, thus generating more traffic
	  than originally sent by the endpoints. Using active measurement with the 
	  active flag requires the use of synthetic (overhead) traffic.</t>
	  
	  <t>Each of the mechanisms that use the flags above has a cost in terms 
	  of the network bandwidth, and may potentially load the node that analyzes 
	  the data. Therefore, it MUST be possible to use each of the mechanisms on 
	  a subset of the data traffic;	an encapsulating node needs to be able to 
	  set the Loopback and Active flag selectively, in a way that considers the 
	  effect on the network performance. Similarly, transit and decapsulating 
	  nodes need to be able to selectively loop back packets with the Loopback 
	  flag, and to selectively export packets.
	  Specifically, rate limiting may be enabled so as to ensure that 
	  the mechanisms are used at a rate that does not significantly affect 
	  the network bandwidth, and does not overload the receiving entity (or the 
	  source node in the case of loopback). </t>
    </section>

	
    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The security considerations of IOAM in general are discussed in 
	  <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data"/>. Specifically, an attacker
	  may try to use the functionality that is defined in this document 
	  to attack the network.</t>
	  
	  <t>An attacker may attempt to overload network devices by injecting 
	  synthetic packets that include an IOAM Trace Option with one or more
	  of the flags defined in this document. Similarly, an on-path attacker
	  may maliciously set one or more of the flags of transit packets.</t>
	  
      <t><list style="symbols">
         <t>Loopback flag: an attacker that sets this flag, either in synthetic
		 packets or transit packet, can potentially cause an amplification,
		 since each device along the path creates a copy of the data packet and
		 sends it back to the source. The attacker can potentially leverage
		 the loopback flag for a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack,
		 as multiple devices send looped-back copies of a packet to a single
		 source.</t>

         <t>Active flag: the impact of synthetic packets with the active
		 flag is no worse than synthetic data packets in which the Active flag 
		 is not set. By setting the active flag in en route packets an attacker
		 can prevent these packets from reaching their destination, since the
		 packet is terminated by the decapsulating device; however, note that 
		 an on-path attacker may achieve the same goal by changing the 
		 destination address of a packet. Another potential threat is 
		 amplification; if an attacker causes transit switches to replicate
		 more packets than they are intended to replicate, either by setting 
		 the Active flag or by sending synthetic packets, then traffic is
		 amplified, causing bandwidth degredation. As mentioned in 
		 <xref target="UseCaseSec"/>, the specification of the replication
		 mechanism is not within the scope of this document. A specification
		 that defines the replication functionality should also address the
		 security aspects of this mechanism.</t>
      </list></t>
	  
	  
	  <t>In order to mitigate the attacks described above, as described in
	  <xref target="Performance"/> it should be possible for IOAM-enabled 
	  devices to selectively apply the mechanisms that use the flags defined in 
	  this document to a subset of the traffic, and to limit the performance of
	  synthetically generated packets to a configurable rate; specifically, 
	  network devices should be able to limit the rate of: (i) looped-back 
	  traffic (at transit nodes), (ii) replicated active packets (at 
	  encapsulating nodes), (iii) packets that are exported to a collector
	  (from either encapsulating nodes or transit nodes), and 
	  (iv) synthetically generated packets (at encapsulating nodes).</t>
	  
	  <t>Furthermore, as defined in <xref target="LoopbackSec"/>, transit nodes
	  that process a packet with the Loopback flag only add a single data
	  field, and truncate any payload that follows the IOAM option(s), 
	  thus significanly limiting the possible impact of an amplification 
	  attack.</t>
	  
	  <t>IOAM is assumed to be deployed in a restricted administrative domain,
	  thus limiting the scope of the threats above and their affect. This is
	  a fundamental assumtion with respect to the security aspects of IOAM, as
	  further discussed in <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data"/>.</t>
