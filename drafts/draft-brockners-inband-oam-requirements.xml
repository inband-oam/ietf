<!-- Comments received 
From Jen Linkova:
1) You are saying:
"In-band mechanisms also don't suffer from implementations, where
probe traffic is handled differently (and potentially forwarded
differently) by a router than regular data traffic"

It is known that in most cases packets with HbH header are processed
differently (CPU/slow path) so the proposed
solution still might suffer from that problem...Do you think it worth
mentioning?

2) The Section 4.2.  MTU and Packet Size
is a bit confusing.

"Based on the transport protocol used MTU is discovered as a
configuration parameter or Path MTU (PMTU) is discovered dynamically."

PMTU can be discovered by a host which sends packet. The intermediate
routers (ingress routers of OAM domain) can not discover PMTU as it
would be reported to the host which sends the packet.

"Example: IPv6 recommends PMTU discovery before data packets are sent
to prevent packet fragmentation."

You can not do PMTUD *before* sending packets. I assume you were going
to say that IPv6 nodes are strongly recommended to *support* PMTUD -
however they can just use MTU of 1280 instead and do not perform
PMTUD.

The next statement:
"It specifies 1280 octets as the default PDU to be carried in a IPv6
datagram.  " is also inaccurate. It is not a default. It is minimal
MTU each IPv6 device must support (so any node could assume that
1280-bytes packet is small enough to be delivered).
If a node supports PMTUD it would use the interface MTU. If it does
not it may use 1280.

IMHO that text should be deleted and the section should say that if
OAM data is inserted at the edge of the domain (by intermediate
routers) than a) MTU on all interfaces with the domain (MTU_INT) MUST
be >= the maximum MTU on any "external" facing interfaces (MTU_EXT)
b) The total size of data to be recorded MUST be <= (MTU_INT - MTU_EXT).


3)" REQ-G5: MTU size: With in-band OAM information added, packets should
            not become larger than the path MTU."

IMHO s/should/MUST/

Obviously MTU and data insertion/removal seem to be the biggest issue.
It would be nice to clarify what happens in the following situations:
a) a packet containing OAM data can not be delivered for some reasons
and ICMP needs to be sent back. If we expect the data to be removed -
then it should be a requirement to support such data removal.
b) what if - despite all effort - the ingress router can not add OAM
data because of the resulting packet size exceeding MTU (it might be a
misconfiguration on a router, for example or smth else. I understand
that it should not happen with the administrative domain normally
but....). Shall it send ICMP "packet too big" back?

4)  REQ-H3 - do you consider a case when you need to record both
logical and physical interfaces? (Looking at OAM-trace-type in another
draft it seems that only one interface ID can be recorded...)


Ignas Bagdonas:

Some assorted comments on your document from the operational perspective.

Overlay and underlay correlation - the information about this
correlation is important to the operator itself, and arguable more
important than to the customer. Ability to find out which underlay
elements are shared by overlays and ability to know which overlays are
mapped to the same underlay elements is needed for capacity and
protection planning. The recorded path information does not directly
answer those two questions, it would require actual overlay traffic to
be present on all possible overlay paths, and even if present, it will
provide reactive feedback. We can argue that this steps into the
pre-deployment plannign aspects, however, it is a function of OAM
mechanism to provide possible indications of how different topologies
corrrelate and map.

Layering awareness should be more than just for overlay and underlay.
Underlay using a form of tunneling dataplanes for protection or traffic
engineering is used in actual deployments. IOAM should be aware of
different layers and be able to record selectively only for the layer of
interest.

SLA verification would be available for the normal conditions of working
path, it would not be able to quantify the standby protection path.

MTU and PMTUD operation on topologies that involve protection - it might
be that the actual MTU of the link changes due to the protection or some
other topology change event, and the MTU negotiated initially is no
longer valid, therefore this would change the ability to transport the
same amount of OAM information as on the previous topology.

Identifiers used for IOAM and "traditional" (for a lack of better word)
OAM should be the same ideally, equivalent if not possible otherwise.
From practical deployment perspective IOAM will be used together with
other OAM and instrumentation mechanisms, and having the same set of
identifiers is definitely a strong requirement.

Security considerations - while it is fashionable to leave it for future
versions of the documents ;-) it is in fact has severe importance. There
must be a mechanism to control the flooding of IOAM-enabled packets
within the device that is disjoint from the topology control (ie, if
topology changes, it should not be assumed that IOAM enabled packets are
allowed to egress on the new interface by default). Mechanisms must be
in place to prevent injection of IOAM enabled packets into the domain.

Overall this is a useful mechanism, it is not a replacement for out of
band OAM mechanisms, nor should it be positioned as one. What should be
ensured is the equivalence of IOAM and OOB OAM mechanisms protocol
mechanics. It takes substantial amount of time for network operations to
gain competence with new network instrumentation mechanisms, and if it
reuses the majority of concepts and protocol mechanics, the adoption
will see less resistance.

    <abstract>
      <t>This document discusses the motivation and requirements for including
      specific operational and telemetry information into data packets while
      the data packet traverses a path between two points in the network. This
      method is referred to as "in-band" Operations, Administration, and
      Maintenance (OAM), given that the OAM information is carried with the
      data packets as opposed to in "out-of-band" packets dedicated to OAM.
      In-band OAM complements other OAM mechanisms which use dedicated probe

    <section title="Introduction" toc="default">
      <t>This document discusses requirements for "in-band" Operations,
      Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) mechanisms. "In-band" OAM means to
      record OAM and telemetry information within the data packet while the
      data packet traverses a network or a particular network domain. The term
      "in-band" refers to the fact that the OAM and telemetry data is carried
      within data packets rather than being sent within packets specifically
      dedicated to OAM. In-band OAM mechanisms, which are sometimes also
      referred to as embedded network telemetry are a current topic of
      discussion. In-band network telemetry has been defined for P4 <xref
      target="P4"/>. The SPUD prototype <xref
      target="I-D.hildebrand-spud-prototype"/> uses a similar logic that
      allows network devices on the path between endpoints to participate
      explicitly in the tube outside the end-to-end context. Even the IPv4
      route-record option defined in <xref target="RFC0791"/> can be
      considered an in-band OAM mechanism. In-band OAM complements
      "out-of-band" mechanisms such as ping or traceroute, or more recent
      active probing mechanisms, as described in <xref
      target="I-D.lapukhov-dataplane-probe"/>. In-band OAM mechanisms can be
      leveraged where current out-of-band mechanisms do not apply or do not
      offer the desired characteristics or requirements, such as proving that
      a certain set of traffic takes a pre-defined path, strict congruency is
      desired, checking service level agreements for the live data traffic,
      detailed statistics on traffic distribution paths in networks that
      distribute traffic across multiple paths, or scenarios where probe
      traffic is potentially handled differently from regular data traffic by
      the network devices. <xref target="RFC7276"/> presents an overview of
      OAM tools.</t>

      <t>Compared to probably the most basic example of "in-band OAM" which is
      IPv4 route recording <xref target="RFC0791"/>, an in-band OAM approach
      has the following capabilities:<list style="letters">
          <t>A flexible data format to allow different types of information to
          be captured as part of an in-band OAM operation, including not only
          path tracing information, but additional operational and telemetry
          information such as timestamps, sequence numbers, or even generic
          data such as queue size, geo-location of the node that forwarded the
          packet, etc.</t>

          <t>A data format to express node as well as link identifiers to
          record the path a packet takes with a fixed amount of added
          data.</t>

          <t>The ability to detect whether any nodes were skipped while
          recording in-band OAM information (i.e., in-band OAM is not
          supported or not enabled on those nodes).</t>

          <t>The ability to actively process information in the packet, for
          example to prove in a cryptographically secure way that a packet
          really took a pre-defined path using some traffic steering method
          such as service chaining or traffic engineering.</t>

          <t>The ability to include OAM data beyond simple path information,
          such as timestamps or even generic data of a particular use
          case.</t>

          <t>The ability to include OAM data in various different transport
          protocols.</t>

      <t>This document defines in-band Operations, Administration, and
      Maintenance (in-band OAM), as the subset in which OAM information is
      carried along with data packets. This is as opposed to "out-of-band
      OAM", where specific packets are dedicated to carrying OAM
      information.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Motivation for In-band OAM">
      <t>In several scenarios it is beneficial to make information about which
      path a packet took through the network available to the operator. This
      includes not only tasks like debugging, troubleshooting, as well as
      network planning and network optimization but also policy or service
      level agreement compliance checks. This section discusses the motivation
      to introduce new methods for enhanced in-band network diagnostics.</t>

      <section title="Path Congruency Issues with Dedicated OAM Packets">
        <t>Mechanisms which add tracing information to the regular data
        traffic, sometimes also referred to as "in-band" or "passive OAM" can
        complement active, probe-based mechanisms such as ping or traceroute,
        which are sometimes considered as "out-of-band", because the messages
        are transported independently from regular data traffic. "In-band"
        mechanisms do not require extra packets to be sent and hence don't
        change the packet traffic mix within the network. Traceroute and ping
        for example use ICMP messages: New packets are injected to get tracing
        information. Those add to the number of messages in a network, which
        already might be highly loaded or suffering performance issues for a
        particular path or traffic type.</t>

        <t>Packet scheduling algorithms, especially for balancing traffic
        across equal cost paths or links, often leverage information contained
        within the packet, such as protocol number, IP-address or MAC-address.
        Probe packets would thus either need to be sent from the exact same
        endpoints with the exact same parameters, or probe packets would need
        to be artificially constructed as "fake" packets and inserted along
        the path. Both approaches are often not feasible from an operational
        perspective, be it that access to the end-system is not feasible, or
        that the diversity of parameters and associated probe packets to be
        created is simply too large. An in-band mechanism is an alternative in
        those cases.</t>

        <t>In-band mechanisms also don't suffer from implementations, where
        probe traffic is handled differently (and potentially forwarded
        differently) by a router than regular data traffic.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Results Sent to a System Other Than the Sender">
        <t>Traditional ping and traceroute tools return the OAM results to the
        sender of the probe. Even when the ICMP messages that are used with
        these tools are enhanced, and additional telemetry is collected (e.g.,
        ICMP Multi-Part <xref target="RFC4884"/> supporting MPLS information
        <xref target="RFC4950"/>, Interface and Next-Hop Identification <xref
        target="RFC5837"/>, etc.), it would be advantageous to separate the
        sending of an OAM probe from the receiving of the telemetry data. In
        this context, it is desired to not assume there is a bidirectional
        working path.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Overlay and Underlay Correlation">
        <t>Several network deployments leverage tunneling mechanisms to create
        overlay or service-layer networks. Examples include VXLAN-GPE, GRE, or
        LISP. One often observed attribute of overlay networks is that they do
        not offer the user of the overlay any insight into the underlay
        network. This means that the path that a particular tunneled packet
        takes, nor other operational details such as the per-hop delay/jitter
        in the underlay are visible to the user of the overlay network, giving
        rise to diagnosis and debugging challenges in case of connectivity or
        performance issues. The scope of OAM tools like ping or traceroute is
        limited to either the overlay or the underlay which means that the
        user of the overlay has typically no access to OAM in the underlay,
        unless specific operational procedures are put in place. With in-band
        OAM the operator of the underlay can offer details of the connectivity
        in the underlay to the user of the overlay. The operator of the egress
        tunnel router could choose to share the recorded information about the
        path with the user of the overlay.</t>

        <t>Coupled with mechanisms such as Segment Routing (SR) <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing"/>, overlay network and
        underlay network can be more tightly coupled: The user of the overlay
        has detailed diagnostic information available in case of failure
        conditions. The user of the overlay can also use the path recording
        information as input to traffic steering or traffic engineering
        mechanisms, to for example achieve path symmetry for the traffic
        between two endpoints. <xref target="I-D.brockners-lisp-sr"/> is an
        example for how these methods can be applied to LISP.</t>

      <section title="SLA Verification">
        <t>In-band OAM can help users of an overlay-service to verify that
        negotiated SLAs for the real traffic are met by the underlay network
        provider. Different from solutions which rely on active probes to test
        an SLA, in-band OAM based mechanisms avoid wrong interpretations and
        "cheating", which can happen if the probe traffic that is used to
        perform SLA-check is prioritized by the network provider of the
        underlay.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Analytics and Diagnostics">
        <t>Network planners and operators benefit from knowledge of the actual
        traffic distribution in the network. When deriving an overall network
        connectivity traffic matrix one typically needs to correlate data
        gathered from each individual devices in the network. If the path of a
        packet is recorded while the packet is forwarded, the entire path that
        a packet took through the network is available to the egress system.
        This obviates the need to retrieve individual traffic statistics from
        every device in the network and correlate those statistics, or employ
        other mechanisms such as leveraging traffic engineering with
        null-bandwidth tunnels just to retrieve the appropriate statistics to
        generate the traffic matrix.</t>

        <t>In addition, with individual path tracing, information is available
        at packet level granularity, rather than only at aggregate level - as
        is usually the case with IPFIX-style methods which employ flow-filters
        at the network elements. Data-center networks which use equal-cost
        multipath (ECMP) forwarding are one example where detailed statistics
        on flow distribution in the network are highly desired. If a network
        supports ECMP, one can create detailed statistics for the different
        paths packets take through the network at the egress system, without a
        need to correlate/aggregate statistics from every router in the
        system. Transit devices are off-loaded from the task of gathering
        packet statistics.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Frame Replication/Elimination Decision for Bi-casting/Active-active Networks">
        <t>Bandwidth- and power-constrained, time-sensitive, or
        loss-intolerant networks (e.g., networks for industry
        automation/control, health care) require efficient OAM methods to
        decide when to replicate packets to a secondary path in order to keep
        the loss/error-rate for the receiver at a tolerable level - and also
        when to stop replication and eliminate the redundant flow. Many IoT
        networks are time sensitive and cannot leverage automatic
        retransmission requests (ARQ) to cope with transmission errors or lost
        packets. Transmitting the data over multiple disparate paths (often
        called bi-casting or live-live) is a method used to reduce the error
        rate observed by the receiver. TSN receive a lot of attention from the
        manufacturing industry as shown by a various standardization
        activities and industry forums being formed (see e.g., IETF 6TiSCH,
        IEEE P802.1CB, AVnu).</t>

      <section anchor="usecase_proof_of_transit" title="Proof of Transit">
        <t>Several deployments use traffic engineering, policy routing,
        segment routing or Service Function Chaining (SFC) <xref
        target="RFC7665"/> to steer packets through a specific set of nodes.
        In certain cases regulatory obligations or a compliance policy require
        to prove that all packets that are supposed to follow a specific path
        are indeed being forwarded across the exact set of nodes specified. If
        a packet flow is supposed to go through a series of service functions
        or network nodes, it has to be proven that all packets of the flow
        actually went through the service chain or collection of nodes
        specified by the policy. In case the packets of a flow weren't
        appropriately processed, a verification device would be required to
        identify the policy violation and take corresponding actions (e.g.,
        drop or redirect the packet, send an alert etc.) corresponding to the
        policy. In today's deployments, the proof that a packet traversed a
        particular service chain is typically delivered in an indirect way:
        Service appliances and network forwarding are in different trust
        domains. Physical hand-off-points are defined between these trust
        domains (i.e., physical interfaces). Or in other terms, in the
        "network forwarding domain" things are wired up in a way that traffic
        is delivered to the ingress interface of a service appliance and
        received back from an egress interface of a service appliance. This
        "wiring" is verified and trusted. The evolution to Network Function
        Virtualization (NFV) and modern service chaining concepts (using
        technologies such as LISP, NSH, Segment Routing, etc.) blurs the line
        between the different trust domains, because the hand-off-points are
        no longer clearly defined physical interfaces, but are virtual
        interfaces. Because of that very reason, networks operators require
        that different trust layers not to be mixed in the same device. For an
        NFV scenario a different proof is required. Offering a proof that a
        packet traversed a specific set of service functions would allow
        network operators to move away from the above described indirect
        methods of proving that a service chain is in place for a particular
        application.</t>

        <t>Deployed service chains without the presence of a "proof of
        transit" mechanism are typically operated as fail-open system: The
        packets that arrive at the end of a service chain are processed.
        Adding "proof of transit" capabilites to a service chain allows an
        operator to turn a fail-open system into a fail-close system, i.e.
        packets that did not properly traverse the service chain can be
        blocked.</t>

        <t>A solution approach could be based on OAM data which is added to
        every packet for achieving Proof Of Transit(POT).The OAM data is updated
        at every hop and is used to verify whether a packet traversed all
        required nodes. When the verifier receives each packet, it can
        validate whether the packet traversed the service chain correctly. The
        detailed mechanisms used for path verification along with the
        procedures applied to the OAM data carried in the packet for path
        verification are beyond the scope of this document. Details are
        addressed in <xref target="I-D.brockners-proof-of-transit"/>. In
        this document the term "proof" refers to a discrete set of bits that
        represents an integer or string carried as OAM data. The OAM data is
        used to verify whether a packet traversed the nodes it is supposed to
        traverse.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Use Cases">
        <t>In-band OAM could be leveraged for several use cases,
        including:<list style="symbols">
            <t>Traffic Matrix: Derive the network traffic matrix: Traffic for
            a given time interval between any two edge nodes of a given
            domain. Could be performed for all traffic or per QoS-class.</t>

            <t>Flow Debugging: Discover which path(s) a particular set of
            traffic (identified by an n-tuple) takes in the network. Such a
            procedure is particularly useful in case traffic is balanced
            across multiple paths, like with link aggregation (LACP) or equal
            cost multi-pathing (ECMP).</t>

            <t>Loss Statistics per Path: Retrieve loss statistics per flow and
            path in the network.</t>

            <t>Path Heat Maps: Discover highly utilized links in the
            network.</t>

            <t>Trend Analysis on Traffic Patterns: Analyze if (and if so how)
            the forwarding path for a specific set of traffic changes over
            time (can give hints to routing issues, unstable links etc.).</t>

            <t>Network Delay Distribution: Show delay distribution across
            network by node or links. If enabled per application or for a
            specific flow then display the path taken along with the delay
            incurred at every hop.</t>

            <t>SLA Verification: Verify that a negotiated service level
            agreement (SLA), e.g., for packet drop rates or delay/jitter is
            conformed to by the actual traffic.</t>

            <t>Low-power Networks: Include application level OAM information
            (e.g., battery charge level, cache or buffer fill level) into data
            traffic to avoid sending extra OAM traffic which incur an extra
            cost on the devices. Using the battery charge level as example,
            one could avoid sending extra OAM packets just to communicate
            battery health, and as such would save battery on sensors.</t>

            <t>Path Verification or Service Function Path Verification: Proof
            and verification of packets traversing check points in the
            network, where check points can be nodes in the network or service
            functions.</t>

            <t>Geo-location Policy: Network policy implemented based on which
            path packets took. Example: Only if packets originated and stayed
            within the trading-floor department, access to specific
            applications or servers is granted.</t>

    <section title="Considerations for In-band OAM">
      <t>The implementation of an in-band OAM mechanism needs to take several
      considerations into account, including administrative boundaries, how
      information is recorded, Maximum Transfer Unit (MTU), Path MTU discovery
      and packet size, etc.</t>

      <section anchor="type_of_iOAM_data"
               title="Type of Information to Be Recorded">
        <t>The information gathered for in-band OAM can be categorized into
        three main categories: Information with a per-hop scope, such as path
        tracing; information which applies to a specific set of nodes, such as
        path or service chain verification; information which only applies to
        the edges of a domain, such as sequence numbers.</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>"edge to edge": Information that needs to be shared between
            network edges (the "edge" of a network could either be a host or a
            domain edge device): Edge to edge data e.g., packet and octet
            count of data entering a well-defined domain and leaving it is
            helpful in building traffic matrix, sequence number (also called
            &ldquo;path packet counters&rdquo;) is useful for the flow to
            detect packet loss.</t>

            <t>"selected hops": Information that applies to a specific set of
            nodes only. In case of path verification, only the nodes which are
            "check points" are required to interpret and update the
            information in the packet.</t>

            <t>"per hop": Information that is gathered at every hop along the
            path a packet traverses within an administrative domain:<list
                style="symbols">
                <t>Hop by Hop information e.g., Nodes visited for path
                tracing, Timestamps at each hop to find delays along the
                path</t>

                <t>Stats collection at each hop to optimize communication in
                resource constrained networks e.g., Battery, CPU, memory
                status of each node piggy backed in a data packet is useful in
                low power lossy networks where network nodes are mostly asleep
                and communication is expensive</t>
              </list></t>
          </list></t>
      </section>

      <section title="MTU and Packet Size">
        <t>The recorded data at every hop may lead to packet size exceeding
        the Maximum Transmit Unit (MTU). Based on the transport protocol used
        MTU is discovered as a configuration parameter or Path MTU (PMTU) is
        discovered dynamically. Example: IPv6 recommends PMTU discovery before
        data packets are sent to prevent packet fragmentation. It specifies
        1280 octets as the default PDU to be carried in a IPv6 datagram. A
        detailed discussion of the implications of oversized IPv6 header
        chains if found in <xref target="RFC7112"/>.</t>

        <t>The Path MTU restricts the amount of data that can be recorded for
        purpose of OAM within a data packet. The total size of data to be
        recorded needs to be preset to avoid packet size exceeding the MTU. It
        is recommended to pre-calculate and configures network devices to
        limit the in-band OAM data that is attached to a packet.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Administrative Boundaries">
        <t>There are several challenges in enabling in-band OAM in the public
        Internet as well as in corporate/enterprise networks across
        administrative domains, which include but are not limited to:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>Deployment dependent, the data fields that in-band OAM requires
            as part of a specific transport protocol may not be supported
            across administrative boundaries.</t>

            <t>Current OAM implementations are often done in the slow path,
            i.e., OAM packets are punted to router&rsquo;s CPU for processing.
            This leads to performance and scaling issues and opens up routers
            for attacks such as Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.</t>

            <t>Discovery of network topology and details of the network
            devices across administrative boundaries may open up attack
            vectors compromising network security.</t>

            <t>Specifically on IPv6: At the administrative boundaries IPv6
            packets with extension headers are dropped for several reasons
            described in <xref target="RFC7872"/>.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>The following considerations will be discussed in a future version
        of this document: If the packet is dropped due to the presence of the
        in-band OAM; If the policy failure is treated as feature disablement
        and any further recording is stopped but the packet itself is not
        dropped, it may lead to every node in the path to make this policy
        decision. </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Selective Enablement">
        <t>Deployment dependent, in-band OAM could either be used for all, or
        only a subset of the overall traffic. While it might be desirable to
        apply in-band OAM to all traffic and then selectively use the data
        gathered in case needed, it might not always be feasible. Depending on
        the forwarding infrastructure used, in-band OAM can have an impact on
        forwarding performance. The SPUD prototype for example uses the notion
        of "pipes" to describe the portion of the traffic that could be
        subject to in-path inspection. Mechanisms to decide which traffic
        would be subject to in-band OAM are outside the scope of this
        document.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Optimization of Node and Interface Identifiers">
        <t>Since packets have a finite maximum size, the data recording or
        carrying capacity of one packet in which the in-band OAM meta data is
        present is limited. In-band OAM should use its own dedicated namespace
        (confined to the domain in-band OAM operates in) to represent node and
        interface IDs to save space in the header. Generic representations of
        node and interface identifiers which are globally unique (such as a
        UUID) would consume significantly more bits of in-band OAM data.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Loop Communication Path (IPv6-specifics)">
        <t>When recorded data is required to be analyzed on a source node that
        issues a packet and inserts in-band OAM data, the recorded data needs
        to be carried back to the source node.</t>

        <t>One way to carry the in-band OAM data back to the source is to
        utilize an ICMP Echo Request/Reply (ping) or ICMPv6 Echo Request/Reply
        (ping6) mechanism. In order to run the in-band OAM mechanism
        appropriately on the ping/ping6 mechanism, the following two
        operations should be implemented by the ping/ping6 target node:</t>

        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>All of the in-band OAM fields would be copied from an Echo
            Request message to an Echo Reply message.</t>

            <t>The Hop Limit field of the IPv6 header of these messages would
            be copied as a continuous sequence. Further considerations are
            addressed in a future version of this document.</t>

    <section title="Requirements for In-band OAM Data Types">
      <t>The above discussed use cases require different types of in-band OAM
      data. This section details requirements for in-band OAM derived from the
      discussion above.</t>

      <section title="Generic Requirements">
        <t><list style="format REQ-G%d:">
            <t>Classification: It should be possible to enable in-band OAM on
            a selected set of traffic. The selected set of traffic can also be
            all traffic.</t>

            <t>Scope: If in-band OAM is used only within a specific domain,
            provisions need to be put in place to ensure that in-band OAM data
            stays within the specific domain only.</t>

            <t>Transport independence: Data formats for in-band OAM shall be
            defined in a transport independent way. In-band OAM applies to a
            variety of transport protocols. Encapsulations should be defined
            how the generic data formats are carried by a specific
            protocol.</t>

            <t>Layering: It should be possible to have in-band OAM information
            for different transport protocol layers be present in several
            fields within a single packet. This could for example be the case
            when tunnels are employed and in-band OAM information is to be
            gathered for both the underlay as well as the overlay network.</t>

            <t>MTU size: With in-band OAM information added, packets should
            not become larger than the path MTU.</t>

            <t>Data Structure Reusability: The data types and data formats
            defined and used for in-band OAM ought to be reusable for
            out-of-band OAM telemetry as well.</t>

             title="Security Considerations and Requirements">
      <t>General Security considerations will be addressed &iacute;n a later
      version of this document. Security considerations for Proof of Transit
      alone are discussed below.</t>

      <section title="Proof of Transit">
        <t>Threat Model: Attacks on the deployments could be due to malicious
        administrators or accidental misconfigurations resulting in bypassing
        of certain nodes. The solution approach should meet the following
        requirements:</t>

        <t><list style="format REQ-SEC%d:">
            <t>Sound Proof of Transit: A valid and verifiable proof that the
            packet definitively traversed through all the nodes as expected.
            Probabilistic methods to achieve this should be avoided, as the
            same could be exploited by an attacker.</t>

            <t>Tampering of meta data: An active attacker should not be able
            to insert or modify or delete meta data in whole or in parts and
            bypass few (or all) nodes. Any deviation from the expected path
            should be accurately determined.</t>

            <t>Replay Attacks: A attacker (active/passive) should not be able
            to reuse the POT bits in the packet by observing the
            OAM data in the packet, packet characteristics (like IP addresses,
            octets transferred, timestamps) or even the proof bits themselves.
            The solution approach should consider usage of these parameters
            for deriving any secrets cautiously. Mitigating replay attacks
            beyond a window of longer duration could be intractable to achieve
            with fixed number of bits allocated for proof.</t>
			
            <t>Preplay Attacks: A active attacker should not be able
            to generate or reuse valid POT bits from legitimate
	    packets, in order to prove to the verifier as valid packets. This
	    slight variant of replay attacks. The attacker extracts POT bits 	    from legitmate packets and ensure they donot reach the verifier. Sub	    sequently reuse those POT bits in crafted packets. </t>

            <t>Recycle Secrets: Any configuration of the secrets (like
            cryptographic keys, initialisation vectors etc.) either in the
            controller or service functions should be reconfigurable. Solution
            approach should enable controls, API calls etc. needed in order to
            perform such recycling. It is desirable to provide recommendations
            on the duration of rotation cycles needed for the secure
            functioning of the overall system.</t>

            <t>Secret storage and distribution: Secrets should be shared with
            the devices over secure channels. Methods should be put in place
            so that secrets cannot be retrieved by non authorized personnel
            from the devices.</t>

    <!-- References split into informative and normative -->

    <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
     1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
     2. simply use a PI "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here
        (for I-Ds: include="reference.I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis.xml")

     Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
     If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
     directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
     with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
     filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->
