    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>IOAM <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data"/> is used for 
	  monitoring traffic in the network by incorporating IOAM information 
	  into data packets.</t> 
	  
	  <t>This document introduces the concept of use case driven IOAM profiles. 
	  An IOAM profile defines a use case or a set of use cases for IOAM, and
	  a set of rules that restrict the scope and features of the IOAM 
	  specification to a subset of the full functionality. Based on the 
	  guidelines in this document, it is expected that future documents may 
	  define one or more IOAM profiles. The current document does not specify 
	  any IOAM profiles.</t>
	  
	  <t>The motivation for defining profiles is to limit the scope of
	  IOAM features, allowing simpler implementation, verification, and
	  interoperability testing in the context of specific use cases that 
	  do not require the full functionality of IOAM.</t>
	  
	  <t>This document does not require any changes in IOAM
	  <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data"/>. Furthermore, it is 
	  expected that future IOAM profile specifications will not require
	  changes in IOAM, since a profile, by definition, derives a subset of
	  the existing functionality.</t>
	  
    </section>

    <section title="Specifying an IOAM Profile">
      <section title="Overview">
		<t>A profile defines a set of rules that limit the scope or 
		functionality of IOAM. By default, any detail in IOAM that 
		is not specifically addressed or limited by the profile is as
		defined in IOAM <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data"/>.
		The rest of this section presents a set of topics that may
		be addressed in a profile specification. A profile may include
		some or all of these topics, and optionally other topics.</t>
      </section>
	  
	  <section title="Use Cases">
	    <t>An IOAM profile should define the use case(s) for using the
		profile. The use case may describe deployment scenarios or
		specific applications that make use of IOAM data. The use case
		should typically define the required functionality from IOAM.
		For example, an IOAM profile may be defined such that it requires
		transit delay monitoring, but does not require path tracing. 
		These requirements then affect which IOAM data fields are used 
		in the profile.</t>
	  </section>

	  <section title="Namespace-ID">
        <t>IOAM namespaces are defined in Section 4.1 of 
		<xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data"/>. 
		An IOAM profile can be bound to a specific Namespace-ID 
		value or to a set of Namespace-ID values. Thus, a profile
		specification may request IANA to allocate one or more 
		Namespace-ID values.</t>
		
		<t>It should be noted that the Namespace-ID is typically used for 
		other purposes, as specified in 
		<xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data"/>, and thus the scope of
		a Namespace and the scope of an IOAM profile are generally 
		independent. However, some profiles may be defined in a way that
		binds the profile to a specific Namespace-ID value or to a specific
		Namespace-ID range. Note that a profile may also be defined
		without being bound to a specific Namesampe-ID, in which case
		the profile specification may not include the current section.</t>
      </section>


  	  <section title="IOAM Options">
        <t>IOAM information may be represented in one of four possible IOAM 
		options: Pre-allocated Trace Option, Incremental Trace Option, Proof 
		Of Transit (POT) Option, and Edge-to-Edge Option. An IOAM profile 
		may specify a subset of allowed options. A profile may define some
		options as mandatory in the current profile, or some options as
		forbidden in the current profile.</t>
		
		<t>For each IOAM option, a profile specification may limit the scope
		of the profile to certain features. For example, a profile may be defined
		to use the Incremental Trace Option such that only specific data types
		are used in the profile, while others are not.</t>
      </section>

  	  <section title="IOAM Option Header Field Values">
		<t>An IOAM profile may define specific values or specific value range for
		some of the fields in the IOAM option headers. For example, a profile may
		define a specific value that is allowed to be used in the Flags field of
		the trace option header.</t>
      </section>
	  
  	  <section title="Opaque State Snapshot">
		<t>The Opaque State Snapshot, as defined in 
		<xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data"/>, is a variable length field that
		may be used in IOAM trace options. The Opaque State Snapshot is defined 
		in a flexible Type/Length/Value manner. An IOAM profile may define a 
		specific format for the Opaque State Snapshot including for example
		a specific length and a specific interpretation of the opaque data.</t>
      </section>
	  
      <section title="Timestamp Format">
        <t>A profile may specify a specific timestamp format to be used in 
		IOAM data fields.</t>
      </section>

	  <section title="Profile Coexistence">
	    <t>An IOAM node may be configured to operate in one or more IOAM profiles.
		If more than one profile is enabled, there should be a way for IOAM nodes
		to distinguish between packets that use different IOAM profiles, e.g.,
		using the Namespace-ID. Therefore, it is recommended that a profile 
		specification includes a definition of how to distinguish between
		packets from different profiles.</t>
      </section>
		
	  <section title="Validity">
		<t>When an IOAM transit node or an IOAM decapsulating node receives a packet
		with one or more IOAM options, it needs to detect which profile the packet
		is bound to. The node then needs to perform validity checks including
		verifying that the packet belongs to one of the profiles that is supported 
		and enabled in the current node, and that all the IOAM options in the current
		packet conform to the profile specification.</t>

		<t>An IOAM transit/decapsulating node that receives a packet with IOAM options 
		that do not pass the validity check can either forward/decapsulate the 
		packet without IOAM processing, or it can process the packet as a conventional 
		IOAM-enabled packet, if it is able to do so and if the network policy allows this 
		behavior.</t>

    <section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>This document does not include any requests from IANA.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The security considerations of IOAM in general are discussed in 
	  <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data"/>. This document presents 
	  the concept of IOAM profiles; since an IOAM profile is 
	  a specific use case of IOAM, any security threat that is 
	  relevant to the profile is also relevant to the full-blown IOAM.
	  Therefore, the current document does not present any new
	  security considerations beyond 
	  <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data"/>.
	  Moreover, in some cases a profile may limit the set of features of 
	  IOAM in a way that reduces the set of potential threats
	  compared a full implementation of IOAM.</t>

    <section anchor="appendix" title="An IOAM Profile Example">
      <section title="Overview">
	    <t>This section presents an example of an IOAM profile specification.
		The profile makes use of the Hop limit, Node ID and Transit delay data
		fields, and is thus called the HNT profile for short.</t>
	  </section>
	  
	  <section title="Use Cases">
	    <t>This profile is intended for path tracing and transit delay 
		monitoring, while using compact data with just two data fields per
		packet. The profile can be useful in networks with a large number of 
		hops.</t> 
	  </section>
	  
  	  <section title="IOAM Options">
	    <t>The HNT profile makes use of the Incremental Trace Option. A packet
		that includes IOAM data according to the current profile includes a 
		single IOAM option - the Incremental Trace Option. Specifically, two
		data fields are used in this profile: the Hop_Lim and node_id field, 
		and the transit delay field.</t>
	  </section>


  	  <section title="IOAM Option Header Field Values">
	    <t>The IOAM-Trace-Type field in the header of the Incremental Trace 
		Option in current profile has a fixed value; Bit 0 (the most 
		significant bit) and Bit 4 are set, while the rest of the bits are 
		zero, indicating the two data fields that are used in the option.</t>
	  </section>

  	  <section title="Opaque State Snapshot">
	    <t>The opaque state snapshot is never used in this profile. Note that 
		the NodeLen field, as defined in 
		<xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data"/>, represents the length of the
		data excluding the opaque state snapshot. Since this field is not used
		in the current profile, the NodeLen represents the actual length of the
		data.</t>
	  </section>
	  
	  <section title="Profile Coexistence">
	    <t>It is assumed that the current profile is used in a confined 
		administrative domain in which no other IOAM profiles are used. 
		Therefore, it is assumed that the current profile does not coexist
		with other profiles.</t> 
	  </section>

	  <section title="Validity">
		<t>An IOAM transit/decapsulating node that receives a packet with IOAM 
		options that do not comply to the current profile should 
		forward/decapsulate the packet without IOAM processing, if it is able 
		to do so. If a decapsulating node is not able to decapsulate an IOAM 
		option that is not compliant to the current profile, the packet is 
		discarded.</t>
