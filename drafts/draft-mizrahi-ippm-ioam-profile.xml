    <abstract>
      <t>In Situ Operations, Administration and Maintenance (IOAM) is used for
	  monitoring network performance and for detecting traffic bottlenecks and 
	  anomalies. This is achieved by incorporating IOAM data into in-flight 
	  data packets. This document introduces the concept of use case-driven 
	  IOAM profiles. An IOAM profile defines a use case or a set of use cases 
	  for IOAM, and an associated set of rules that restrict the scope and 
	  features of the IOAM specification, thereby limiting it to a subset of 
	  the full functionality. The motivation for defining profiles is to limit 
	  the scope of IOAM features, allowing simpler implementation, 
	  verification, and interoperability testing in the context of specific use 
	  cases that do not require the full functionality of IOAM.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>IOAM <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data"/> is used for 
	  monitoring traffic in the network by incorporating IOAM data fields 
	  into in-flight data packets.</t> 
	  
	  <t>This document introduces the concept of use case driven IOAM profiles.
	  The motivation for defining profiles is to limit the scope of
	  IOAM features, allowing simpler implementation, verification, and
	  interoperability testing in the context of specific use cases that 
	  do not require the full functionality of IOAM.</t>

	  <t>An IOAM profile defines a use case or a set of use cases for IOAM, and
	  an associated set of rules that restrict the scope and features of the 
	  IOAM specification, thereby limiting it to a subset of the full 
	  functionality. Based on the guidelines in this document, future documents 
	  may define one or more IOAM profiles. The current document does not 
	  specify any IOAM profiles.</t>

	  
	  <t>This document does not require any changes to the Data Fields for In-situ OAM 
	  <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data"/>. Furthermore, it is 
	  expected that future IOAM profile specifications will not require
	  changes to IOAM, since a profile, by definition, derives a subset of
	  the existing functionality.</t>
	  
    </section>

    <section title="Specifying an IOAM Profile">
      <section title="Overview">
		<t>A profile defines a set of rules that limit the scope or 
		functionality of IOAM. By default, any detail in IOAM that 
		is not specifically addressed or limited by the profile is as
		defined in IOAM <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data"/>.
		The rest of this section presents a set of topics that may
		be addressed in a profile specification. A profile may include
		some or all of these topics, and optionally other topics.</t>
		
		<t>A profile may in part be defined using a specific assignment to the 
		IOAM YANG model. The IOAM YANG model 
		<xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-yang"/> defines a set of IOAM-related
		attributes, such as which IOAM option types are enabled, and which data
		fields are used. For example, an IOAM profile that only uses the
		icremental trace option may be defined as such by an assignment to 
		the respective attributes that are defined in the YANG model. It should 
		be noted that while the YANG model assists in the definition of a 
		profile, it does not replace the profile definition. Specifically, a 
		profile definition includes the use case(s) for using the profile, and 
		possibly some properties that cannot be defined by an assignment to the 
		YANG model, such as the semantics of the Opaque State Snapshot field.
		</t>
      </section>
	  
	  <section title="Use Cases">
	    <t>An IOAM profile should define the use case(s) for using the
		profile. The use case may describe deployment scenarios or
		specific applications that make use of IOAM data. The use case
		should typically define the required functionality from IOAM.
		For example, an IOAM profile may be defined such that it requires
		transit delay monitoring, but does not require path tracing. 
		These requirements then affect which IOAM data fields are used 
		in the profile.</t>
	  </section>

  	  <section title="IOAM Options">
        <t>IOAM data may be represented in one of four possible IOAM 
		options: Pre-allocated Trace Option, Incremental Trace Option, Proof 
		Of Transit (POT) Option, and Edge-to-Edge Option. An IOAM profile 
		may specify a subset of allowed options. A profile may define some
		options as mandatory in the current profile, or some options as
		forbidden in the current profile. Moreover, in cases where IOAM
		defines several possible modes of operation, a profile may choose
		one of these modes of operation as the only allowed mode.</t>
		
		<t>For each IOAM option, a profile specification may limit the scope
		of the profile to certain features. For example, a profile may be defined
		to use the Incremental Trace Option such that only specific data types
		are used in the profile, while others are not.</t>
      </section>

  	  <section title="IOAM Option Header Field Values">
		<t>An IOAM profile may define specific values or specific value range for
		some of the fields in the IOAM option headers. For example, a profile may
		define a specific value that is allowed to be used in the Flags field of
		the trace option header.</t>
      </section>
	  
  	  <section title="Opaque State Snapshot">
		<t>The Opaque State Snapshot, as defined in 
		<xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data"/>, is a variable length field that
		may be used in IOAM trace options. The Opaque State Snapshot is defined 
		in a flexible Type/Length/Value manner. An IOAM profile may define a 
		specific format for the Opaque State Snapshot including for example
		a specific length and a specific interpretation of the opaque data. 
	    In this case, the IOAM profile ought to also specify a Schema ID value.</t>
      </section>
	  
      <section title="Timestamp Format">
        <t>A profile may specify a specific timestamp format to be used in 
		IOAM data fields.</t>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The security considerations of IOAM in general are discussed in 
	  <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data"/>. This document presents 
	  the concept of IOAM profiles; since an IOAM profile is 
	  a specific use case of IOAM, any security threat that is 
	  relevant to the profile is also relevant to the full-blown IOAM,
	  as defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data"/>.
	  Therefore, the current document does not present any new
	  security considerations beyond 
	  <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data"/>.</t>
	  <t>Moreover, in some cases a profile may limit the set of features of 
	  IOAM in a way that reduces the set of potential threats
	  compared to a full implementation of IOAM. In fact, a particular IOAM
	  profile can optimize a particular security posture or requirement.</t>

    <section anchor="appendix" title="An IOAM Profile Example">
      <section title="Overview">
	    <t>This section presents an example of an IOAM profile specification.
		The profile makes use of the Hop limit, Node ID and Transit delay data
		fields, and is thus called the HNT profile for short.</t>
	  </section>
	  
	  <section title="Use Cases">
	    <t>This profile is intended for path tracing and transit delay 
		monitoring, while using compact data with just two data fields per
		packet. The profile can be useful in networks with a large number of 
		hops.</t> 
	  </section>
	  
  	  <section title="IOAM Options">
	    <t>The HNT profile makes use of the Incremental Trace Option. A packet
		that includes IOAM data according to the current profile includes a 
		single IOAM option - the Incremental Trace Option. Specifically, two
		data fields are used in this profile: the Hop_Lim and node_id field, 
		and the transit delay field.</t>
	  </section>


  	  <section title="IOAM Option Header Field Values">
	    <t>The IOAM-Trace-Type field in the header of the Incremental Trace 
		Option in this profile has a fixed value; Bit 0 (the most 
		significant bit) and Bit 4 are set, while the rest of the bits are 
		zero, indicating the two data fields that are used in the option.</t>
	  </section>

  	  <section title="Opaque State Snapshot">
	    <t>The opaque state snapshot is never used in this profile. Note that 
		the NodeLen field, as defined in 
		<xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data"/>, represents the length of the
		data excluding the opaque state snapshot. Since this field is not used
		in the current profile, the NodeLen represents the actual length of the
		data.</t>
	  </section>
	  
	  <section title="Profile Coexistence">
	    <t>It is assumed that the current profile is used in a confined 
		administrative domain in which no other IOAM profiles are used. 
		Therefore, it is assumed that the current profile does not coexist
		with other profiles.</t> 
	  </section>

	  <section title="Validity">
		<t>An IOAM transit/decapsulating node that receives a packet with IOAM 
		options that do not comply to the current profile should 
		forward/decapsulate the packet without IOAM processing, if it is able 
		to do so. If a decapsulating node is not able to decapsulate an IOAM 
		option that is not compliant to the current profile, the packet is 
		discarded.</t>
