	<section anchor="LoopbackSec" title="Loopback in IOAM">
 	    <t>Loopback is used for trigerring each transit device along
		the path to loop back a copy of the data packet.
		Loopback mode assumes that a return path from transit nodes
 	    and destination nodes towards the source exists. The
 	    encapsulating node decides (e.g., using a filter) which
 	    packets loopback mode is enabled for by setting the loopback
 	    bit. The encapsulating node also needs to ensure that
 	    sufficient space is available in the IOAM header for
 	    loopback operation, which includes intermediate nodes adding
 	    trace data on the original path and then again on the return
 	    path. A loopback bit that is set indicates to the transit
 	    nodes processing this option that they are to create a copy
 	    of the received packet and send the copy back to the source
 	    of the packet. The copy has its metadata added after being
 	    copied in order to allow any egress-dependent information to
 	    be set based on the egress of the copy rather than the
 	    original. The original packet continues towards its
 	    destination. The source address of the original packet is
 	    used as the destination address in the copied packet. The
 	    address of the node performing the copy operation is used as
 	    the source address. The L-bit MUST be cleared in the copy of
 	    the packet that a node sends back towards the source. On its
 	    way back towards the source, the copied packet is processed
 	    like any other packet with IOAM information, including
 	    adding any requested data at each transit node (assuming
 	    there is sufficient space). Once the return packet reaches
 	    the IOAM domain boundary, IOAM decapsulation occurs as with
 	    any other packet containing IOAM information. Because any
 	    intermediate node receiving such a packet would not know how
 	    to process the original packet, and because there would be a
 	    risk of the original packet leaking past the initiator of
 	    the IOAM loopback, the initiator of an IOAM loopback MUST be
 	    the initiator of the packet. Once a loopback packet is
 	    received back at the initiator, it is a local matter how it
 	    is recognized as a loopback packet.</t>

    <section anchor="UseCaseSec" title="Active Measurement with IOAM">

	  <t>Active measurement methods <xref target="RFC7799"/> make use of 
	  synthetically generated packets in order to facilitate the measurement.
	  This section presents use cases of active measurement using the IOAM
	  Active flag.</t>

	  <t>The active flag indicates that a packet is used for active 
	  measurement. An IOAM decapsulating node that receives a packet with 
	  the Active flag set in one of its Trace options must terminate the 
	  packet.</t>

 	  <t>An example of an IOAM deployment scenario is illustrated in
	  <xref target="NetworkFig"></xref>. The figure depicts two endpoints,
	  a source and a destination. The data traffic from the source to the
	  destination is forwarded through a set of network devices, including
	  an IOAM encapsulating node, which incorporates one or more IOAM 
	  option, a decapsulating node, which removes the IOAM options, optionally
	  one or more transit nodes. The IOAM options are encapsulated in one
	  of the IOAM encapsulation types, e.g., 
	  <xref target="I-D.ietf-sfc-ioam-nsh"/>, or 
	  <xref target="I-D.ioametal-ippm-6man-ioam-ipv6-options"/>.</t>

	  <t>This draft focuses on three possible use cases of active measurement
	  using IOAM. These use cases are described using the example of 
	  <xref target="NetworkFig"></xref>.</t>
	  
	  
      <t><list style="symbols">
         <t>Endpoint active measurement: synthetic probe packets are sent 
		 between the source and destination, traversing the IOAM domain.
		 Since the probe packets are sent between the endpoints, these packets
		 are treated as data packets by the IOAM domain, and do not require
		 special treatment at the IOAM layer.</t>

         <t>IOAM active measurement using probe packets: probe packets are 
		 generated and transmitted by the IOAM encapsulating node, and are
		 expected to be terminated by the decapsulating node. IOAM data related
		 to probe packets may be exported by one or more nodes along its path,
		 by an exporting protocol that is outside the scope of this document
		 (e.g., <xref target="I-D.spiegel-ippm-ioam-rawexport"/>). Probe 
		 packets include a Trace Option which has its Active flag set, 
		 indicating that the decapsulating node must terminate them.</t>

         <t>IOAM active measurement using replicated data packets: probe 
		 packets are created by the encapsulating node by selecting some or 
		 all of the en route data packets and replicating them. A selected data 
		 packet that is replicated, and its (possibly truncated) copy is 
		 forwarded with one or more IOAM option, while the original packet is
		 forwarded normally, without IOAM options. To the extent possible, the 
		 original data packet and its replica are forwarded through the same 
		 path. The replica includes a Trace Option that has its Active flag 
		 set, indicating that the decapsulating node should terminate it.
		 </t>
	  </list></t>
	  
	</section>

	<section anchor="ImmediateSec" title="Immediate Exporting">
		<t>Immediate exporting can be used to export IOAM data to a collector
		instead of incorporating this data into en route data packets.
		The various types of IOAM nodes MUST process packets with the
        I-bit set as follows:</t>

        <t><list style="numbers">
                      <t>An encapsulating IOAM node configured to set the
                      I-bit encapsulates the packet with the IOAM header and
                      sets the I-bit, leaving the IOAM header without locally
                      collected data, and exports the requested IOAM data
                      immediately. The encapsulating IOAM node is the only
                      type of node allowed to set the I-bit.</t>

                      <t>A transit node that processes a packet with the I-bit
                      set is expected to export the requested IOAM data, and
                      not incorporate it into the IOAM header.</t>

                      <t>A decapsulating IOAM node that processes a packet
                      with the I-bit set is expected to export the requested
                      IOAM data, and decapsulate the IOAM header.</t>
        </list></t>

        <t>Note that in case of "Immediate Export" being employed,
        no IOAM trace data is added to the packets traversing the
        network. As a means to support correlation of exported IOAM
        data different nodes in the network, a deployment could
        consider attaching an IOAM E2E option in addition to the
        trace option, that includes a sequence number. See Bit 1 in
        the IOAM-E2E-Types. Please refer to 
		<xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data"/> for a discussion of IOAM data 
		export and associated formats.</t>

    <section anchor="Performance" title="Performance Considerations">
      <t>Each of the three flags that are defined in this document may have
	  performance implications. When using the loopback mechanism a copy of
	  the data packet is sent back to the sender, thus generating more traffic
	  than originally sent by the endpoints. Using active measurement with the 
	  active flag requires the use of synthetic (overhead) traffic. The 
	  Immediate Export flag triggers exported packets to be exported to a 
	  collector, which in some cases may impact the collector's performance, 
	  or the performance along the paths leading to the collector.</t>
	  
	  <t>Each of the three mechanisms has a cost in terms of the network 
	  bandwidth, and may potentially load the node that analyzes the data. 
	  Therefore, rate limiting may be enabled so as to ensure that the 
	  three mechanisms are used at a rate that does not significantly affect 
	  the network bandwidth, and does not overload the collector (or the 
	  source node in the case of loopback). It should be possible to use 
	  each of the three mechanisms on a subset of the data traffic.</t>
    </section>

	
    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The security considerations of IOAM in general are discussed in 
	  <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data"/>. Specifically, an attacker
	  may try to use the functionality that is defined in this document 
	  to attack the network.</t>
	  
	  <t>An attacker may attempt to overload network devices by injecting 
	  synthetic packets that include an IOAM Trace Option with one or more
	  of the flags defined in this document. Similarly, an on-path attacker
	  may maliciously set one or more of the flags of transit packets.</t>
	  
      <t><list style="symbols">
         <t>Loopback flag: an attacker that sets this flag, either in synthetic
		 packets or transit packet, can potentially cause an amplification,
		 since each device along the path creates a copy of the data packet and
		 sends it back to the source. The attacker can potentially leverage
		 the loopback flag for a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack,
		 as multiple devices send looped-back copies of a packet to a single
		 source.</t>

         <t>Active flag: the impact of synthetic packets with the active
		 flag is no worse than synthetic data packets in which the Active flag 
		 is not set. By setting the active flag in en route packets an attacker
		 can prevent these packets from reaching their destination, since the
		 packet is terminated by the decapsulating device; however, note that 
		 an on-path attacker may achieve the same goal by changing the 
		 destination address of a packet. Another potential threat is 
		 amplification; if an attacker causes transit switches to replicate
		 more packets than they are intended to replicate, either by setting 
		 the Active flag or by sending synthetic packets, then traffic is
		 amplified, causing bandwidth degredation.</t>

		 <t>Immediate Export flag: setting this flag, either in synthetic 
		 packets or in transit packets may overload the collector or analyzer 
		 devices. Since this flag affects multiple devices along the network
		 path, it potentially amplifies the effect on the network bandwidth and
		 on the collector's load.</t>
      </list></t>
	  
	  
	  <t>In order to mitigate the attacks described above, it should be 
	  possible for IOAM-enabled devices to limit each of the three mechanisms
	  to a configurable rate; Network devices should be able to limit the rate
	  of: (i) looped-back traffic, (ii) replicated active packets, and 
	  (iii) exported packets.</t>
	  
	  <t>IOAM is assumed to be deployed in a restricted administrative domain,
	  thus limiting the scope of the threats above and their affect. This is
	  a fundamental assumtion with respect to the security aspects of IOAM, as
	  further discussed in <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data"/>.</t>
