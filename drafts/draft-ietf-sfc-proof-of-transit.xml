To summarize my take on this thread:
The proposed mechanism has two significant vulnerabilities that (in my understanding) are currently not addressed:
1.       A man-in-the-middle can replace the POT of packet A with the POT of packet B.
2.       It is possible to replay POTs within a certain time window, whose length is determined by the timestamp resolution.

    <abstract>
      <t>Several technologies such as Traffic Engineering (TE), Service
      Function Chaining (SFC), and policy based routing are used to steer
      traffic through a specific, user-defined path. This document defines
      mechanisms to securely prove that traffic transited a defined path.
      These mechanisms allow to securely verify whether, within a given path,
      all packets traversed all the nodes that they are supposed to visit. The
      document defines the data model through Unified Modeling Language (UML)
      class diagrams and formally specifies it using a NDMA- compliant YANG
      model to enable these mechanisms.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Several deployments use Traffic Engineering, policy routing, Segment
      Routing (SR), and Service Function Chaining (SFC) <xref
      target="RFC7665"></xref> to steer packets through a specific set of
      nodes. In certain cases, regulatory obligations or a compliance policy
      require operators to prove that all packets that are supposed to follow
      a specific path are indeed being forwarded across and exact set of
      pre-determined nodes.</t>

      <t>If a packet flow is supposed to go through a series of service
      functions or network nodes, it has to be proven that indeed all packets
      of the flow followed the path or service chain or collection of nodes
      specified by the policy. In case some packets of a flow weren't
      appropriately processed, a verification device should determine the
      policy violation and take corresponding actions corresponding to the
      policy (e.g., drop or redirect the packet, send an alert etc.) In
      today's deployments, the proof that a packet traversed a particular path
      or service chain is typically delivered in an indirect way: Service
      appliances and network forwarding are in different trust domains.
      Physical hand-off-points are defined between these trust domains (i.e.
      physical interfaces). Or in other terms, in the "network forwarding
      domain" things are wired up in a way that traffic is delivered to the
      ingress interface of a service appliance and received back from an
      egress interface of a service appliance. This "wiring" is verified and
      then trusted upon. The evolution to Network Function Virtualization
      (NFV) and modern service chaining concepts (using technologies such as
      Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP), Network Service Header (NSH),
      Segment Routing (SR), etc.) blurs the line between the different trust
      domains, because the hand-off-points are no longer clearly defined
      physical interfaces, but are virtual interfaces. As a consequence,
      different trust layers should not to be mixed in the same device. For an
      NFV scenario a different type of proof is required. Offering a proof
      that a packet indeed traversed a specific set of service functions or
      nodes allows operators to evolve from the above described indirect
      methods of proving that packets visit a predetermined set of nodes.</t>

      <t>The solution approach presented in this document is based on a small
      portion of operational data added to every packet. This "in-situ"
      operational data is also referred to as "proof of transit data", or POT
      data. The POT data is updated at every required node and is used to
      verify whether a packet traversed all required nodes. A particular set
      of nodes "to be verified" is either described by a set of shares of a
      single secret. Nodes on the path retrieve their individual shares of the
      secret using Shamir's Secret Sharing scheme from a central controller.
      The complete secret set is only known to the controller and a verifier
      node, which is typically the ultimate node on a path that performs
      verification. Each node in the path uses its share of the secret to
      update the POT data of the packets as the packets pass through the node.
      When the verifier receives a packet, it uses its key along with data
      found in the packet to validate whether the packet traversed the path
      correctly. This document defines a data model and specifies it formally
      using the YANG 1.1 <xref target="RFC7950"></xref> data modeling language
      to support enabling the POT solution.</t>

    <section title="Proof of Transit">
      <t>This section discusses methods and algorithms to provide for a "proof
      of transit" (POT) for packets traversing a specific path. A path which
      is to be verified consists of a set of nodes. Transit of the data
      packets through those nodes is to be proven. Besides the nodes, the
      setup also includes a Controller that creates secrets and secrets shares
      and configures the nodes for POT operations.</t>

      <t>The methods how traffic is identified and associated to a specific
      path is outside the scope of this document. Identification could be done
      using a filter (e.g., 5-tuple classifier), or an identifier which is
      already present in the packet (e.g., path or service identifier, NSH
      Service Path Identifier (SPI), flow-label, etc.)</t>

      <t>When used in the context of IOAM, the POT information MUST be
      encapsulated in packets as an IOAM Proof of Transit Option-Type. The
      details and format of the encapsulation and the IOAM POT Option-Type
      format are specified in <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data"></xref>.
      When used in conjunction with NSH <xref target="RFC8300"></xref>, the
      POT Option-Type MUST be carried as specified in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-sfc-ioam-nsh"></xref>.</t>

      <t>The solution approach is detailed in two steps. Initially the concept
      of the approach is explained. This concept is then further refined to
      make it operationally feasible.</t>

      <section title="Basic Idea">
        <t>The method relies on adding POT data to all packets that traverse a
        path. The added POT data allows a verifying node (egress node) to
        check whether a packet traversed the identified set of nodes on a path
        correctly or not. Security mechanisms are natively built into the
        generation of the POT data to protect against misuse (e.g.,
        configuration mistakes). The mechanism for POT leverages "Shamir's
        Secret Sharing" scheme <xref target="SSS"></xref>.</t>

        <t>Shamir's secret sharing base idea: A polynomial (represented by its
        coefficients) of degree k is chosen as a secret by the controller. A
        polynomial represents a curve. A set of k+1 points on the curve define
        the polynomial and are thus needed to (re-)construct the polynomial.
        Each of these k+1 points of the polynomial is called a
        &ldquo;share&rdquo; of the secret. A single secret is associated with
        a particular set of k+1 nodes, which typically represent the path to
        be verified. k+1 shares of the single secret (i.e., k+1 points on the
        curve) are securely distributed from a Controller to the network
        nodes. Nodes use their respective share to update a cumulative value
        in the POT data of each packet. Only a verifying node has access to
        the complete secret. The verifying node validates the correctness of
        the received POT data by reconstructing the curve.</t>

        <t>The polynomial cannot be reconstructed if any of the points are
        missed or tampered. Per Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme, any lesser
        points means one or more nodes are missed. Details of the precise
        configuration needed for achieving security are discussed further
        below.</t>

        <t>While applicable in theory, a vanilla approach based on Shamir's
        Secret Sharing Scheme could be easily attacked. If the same polynomial
        is reused for every packet for a path a passive attacker could reuse
        the value. As a consequence, one could consider creating a different
        polynomial per packet. Such an approach would be operationally
        complex. It would be complex to configure and recycle so many curves
        and their respective points for each node. Rather than using a single
        polynomial, two polynomials are used for the solution approach: A
        secret polynomial as described above which is kept constant, and a
        per-packet polynomial which is public and generated by the ingress
        node (the first node along the path). Operations are performed on the
        sum of those two polynomials - creating a third polynomial which is
        secret and per packet.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Solution Approach">
        <t>Solution approach: The overall algorithm uses two polynomials:
        POLY-1 and POLY-2. POLY-1 is secret and constant. A different POLY-1
        is used for each path, and its value is known to the controller and to
        the verifier of the respective path. Each node gets a point on POLY-1
        at setup-time and keeps it secret. POLY-2 is public, random and per
        packet. Each node generates a point on POLY-2 each time a packet
        crosses it. Each node then calculates (point on POLY-1 + point on
        POLY-2) to get a (point on POLY-3) and passes it to verifier by adding
        it to each packet. The verifier constructs POLY-3 from the points
        given by all the nodes and cross checks whether POLY-3 = POLY-1 +
        POLY-2. Only the verifier knows POLY-1.</t>

        <t>The solution leverages finite field arithmetic in a field of size
        &ldquo;prime number&rdquo;, i.e. all operations are performed "modulo
        prime number".</t>

        <t>Detailed algorithms are discussed next. A simple example that
        describes how the algorithms work is discussed in <xref
        target="toy-example"></xref>.</t>

        <t>The algorithms themselves do not constrain the ranges of possible
        values for the different parameters and coefficients used. A
        deployment of the algorithms will always need to define appropriate
        ranges. Please refer to the YANG model in <xref target="YANG"></xref>

        <section title="Setup">
          <t>A controller generates a first polynomial (POLY-1) of degree k
          and k+1 points on the polynomial, corresponding to the k+1 nodes
          along the path. The constant coefficient of POLY-1 is considered the
          SECRET, which is per the definition of the SSSS algorithm <xref
          target="SSS"></xref>. The k+1 points are used to derive the Lagrange
          Basis Polynomials. The Lagrange Polynomial Constants (LPC) are
          retrieved from the constant coefficients of the Lagrange Basis
          Polynomials. Each of the k+1 nodes (including verifier) are assigned
          a point on the polynomial i.e., shares of the SECRET. The verifier
          is configured with the SECRET. The Controller also generates
          coefficients (except the constant coefficient, called "RND", which
          is changed on a per packet basis) of a second polynomial POLY-2 of
          the same degree. Each node is configured with the LPC of POLY-2.
          Note that POLY-2 is public.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="In Transit">
          <t>For each packet, the ingress node generates a random number
          (RND). It is considered as the constant coefficient for POLY-2. A
          cumulative value (CML) is initialized to 0. Both RND, CML are
          carried as within the packet POT data. As the packet visits each
          node, the RND is retrieved from the packet and the respective share
          of POLY-2 is calculated. Each node calculates (Share(POLY-1) +
          Share(POLY-2)) and CML is updated with this sum, specifically each
          node performs</t>

          <t>CML = CML+(((Share(POLY-1)+ Share(POLY-2)) * LPC) mod Prime, with
          "LPC" being the Lagrange Polynomial Constant and "Prime" being the
          prime number which defines the finite field arithmetic that all
          operations are done over. Please also refer to <xref
          target="enhanced-version"></xref> below for further details how the
          operations are performed.</t>

          <t>This step is performed by each node until the packet completes
          the path. The verifier also performs the step with its respective
          share.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Verification">
          <t>The verifier cross checks whether CML = SECRET + RND. If this
          matches then the packet traversed the specified set of nodes in the
          path. This is due to the additive homomorphic property of Shamir's
          Secret Sharing scheme.</t>

        <t>This section shows a simple example to illustrate step by step the
        approach described above. The example assumes a network with 3 nodes.
        The last node that packets traverse also serves as the verifier. A
        Controller communicates the required parameters to the individual

        <section title="Baseline">

          <t>Choices: Prime = 53. POLY-1(x) = (3x^2 + 3x + 10) mod 53. The
          secret to be re-constructed is the constant coefficient of POLY-1,
          i.e., SECRET=10. It is important to note that all operations are
          done over a finite field (i.e., modulo Prime = 53).</t>

          <section title="Secret Shares">
            <t>The shares of the secret are the points on POLY-1 chosen for

          <section title="Random Polynomial">
            <t>Let the second polynomial POLY-2 be (RND + 7x + 10 x^2). RND is
            a random number and is generated for each packet. Note that POLY-2
            is public and need not be kept secret. The nodes can be
            pre-configured with the non-constant coefficients (for example, 7
            and 10 in this case could be configured through the Controller on
            each node). So precisely only the RND value changes per packet and
            is public and the rest of the non-constant coefficients of POLY-2
            is kept secret.</t>

        <section title="Solution Deployment Considerations">
          <t>The "complete solution" described above in <xref
          target="enhanced-version"></xref> could still be prone to replay or
          preplay attacks. An attacker could e.g. reuse the POT metadata for
          bypassing the verification. These threats can be mitigated by
          appropriate parameterization of the algorithm. Please refer to <xref
          target="Security"></xref> for details.</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="Operational Aspects">
        <t>To operationalize this scheme, a central controller is used to
        generate the necessary polynomials, the secret share per node, the
        prime number, etc. and distributing the data to the nodes
        participating in proof of transit. The identified node that performs
        the verification is provided with the verification key. The
        information provided from the Controller to each of the nodes
        participating in proof of transit is referred to as a proof of transit
        profile (POT-Profile). Also note that the set of nodes for which the
        transit has to be proven are typically associated to a different trust
        domain than the verifier. Note that building the trust relationship
        between the Controller and the nodes is outside the scope of this
        document. Techniques such as those described in <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-anima-autonomic-control-plane"></xref> might be
        applied.</t>

        <t>To optimize the overall data amount of exchanged and the processing
        at the nodes the following optimizations are performed:<list
            style="numbers">
            <t>The points (x, y) for each of the nodes on the public and
            private polynomials are picked such that the x component of the
            points match. This lends to the LPC values which are used to
            calculate the cumulative value CML to be constant. Note that the
            LPC are only depending on the x components. They can be computed
            at the controller and communicated to the nodes. Otherwise, one
            would need to distributed the x components to all the nodes.</t>

            <t>A pre-evaluated portion of the public polynomial for each of
            the nodes is calculated and added to the POT-Profile. Without this
            all the coefficients of the public polynomial had to be added to
            the POT profile and each node had to evaluate them. As stated
            before, the public portion is only the constant coefficient RND
            value, the pre-evaluated portion for each node should be kept
            secret as well.</t>

            <t>To provide flexibility on the size of the cumulative and random
            numbers carried in the POT data a field to indicate this is shared
            and interpreted at the nodes.</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="mask-opot" title="Ordered POT (OPOT)">
        <t>POT as discussed in this document so far only verifies that a
        defined set of nodes have been traversed by a packet. The order in
        which nodes where traversed is not verified. "Ordered Proof of Transit
        (OPOT)" addresses the need of deployments, that require to verify the
        order in which nodes were traversed. OPOT extends the POT scheme with
        symmetric masking between the nodes.</t>

        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>For each path the controller provisions all the nodes with (or
            asks them to agree on) two secrets per node, that we will refer to
            as masks, one for the connection from the upstream node(s),
            another for the connection to the downstream node(s). For obvious
            reasons, the ingress and egress (verifier) nodes only receive one,
            for downstream and upstream, respectively.</t>

            <t>Any two contiguous nodes in the OPOT stream share the mask for
            the connection between them, in the shape of symmetric keys. Masks
            can be refreshed as per-policy, defined at each hop or globally by
            the controller.</t>

            <t>Each mask has the same size in bits as the length assigned to
            CML plus RND, as described in the above sections.</t>

            <t>Whenever a packet is received at an intermediate node, the
            CML+RND sequence is deciphered (by XORing, though other ciphering
            schemas MAY be possible) with the upstream mask before applying
            the procedures described in <xref
            target="enhanced-version"></xref>.</t>

            <t>Once the new values of CML+RND are produced, they are ciphered
            (by XORing, though other ciphering schemas MAY be possible) with
            the downstream mask before transmitting the packet to the next
            node downstream.</t>

            <t>The ingress node only applies step 5 above, while the verifier
            only applies step 4 before running the verification procedure.</t>
          </list>The described process allows the verifier to check if the
        packet has followed the correct order while traversing the path. In
        particular, the reconstruction process will fail if the order is not
        respected, as the deciphering process will produce invalid CML and RND
        values, and the interpolation (secret reconstruction) will finally
        generate a wrong verification value.</t>

        <t>This procedure does not impose a high computational burden, does
        not require additional packet overhead, can be deployed on chains of
        any length, does not require any node to be aware of any additional
        information than the upstream and downstream masks, and can be
        integrated with the other operational mechanisms applied by the
        controller to distribute shares and other secret material.</t>

    <section title="Node Configuration">
      <t>A POT system consists of a number of nodes that participate in POT
      and a Controller, which serves as a control and configuration entity.
      The Controller is to create the required parameters (polynomials, prime
      number, etc.) and communicate the associated values (i.e. prime number,
      secret-share, LPC, etc.) to the nodes. The sum of all parameters for a
      specific node is referred to as "POT-Profile". For details see the YANG
      model in <xref target="YANG"></xref>.This document does not define a
      specific protocol to be used between Controller and nodes. It only
      defines the procedures and the associated YANG data model.</t>

      <section anchor="Procedure" title="Procedure">
        <t>The Controller creates new POT-Profiles at a constant rate and
        communicates the POT-Profile to the nodes. The controller labels a
        POT-Profile &ldquo;even&rdquo; or &ldquo;odd&rdquo; and the Controller
        cycles between &ldquo;even&rdquo; and &ldquo;odd&rdquo; labeled
        profiles. This means that the parameters for the algorithms are
        continuously refreshed. Please refer to <xref
        target="metadata-for-pot"></xref> for choosing an appropriate refresh
        rate: The rate at which the POT-Profiles are communicated to the nodes
        is configurable and MUST be more frequent than the speed at which a
        POT-Profile is "used up". Once the POT-Profile has been successfully
        communicated to all nodes (e.g., all NETCONF transactions completed,
        in case NETCONF is used as a protocol), the controller sends an
        &ldquo;enable POT-Profile&rdquo; request to the ingress node.</t>

        <t>All nodes maintain two POT-Profiles (an even and an odd
        POT-Profile): One POT-Profile is currently active and in use; one
        profile is standby and about to get used. A flag in the packet is
        indicating whether the odd or even POT-Profile is to be used by a
        node. This is to ensure that during profile change the service is not
        disrupted. If the &ldquo;odd&rdquo; profile is active, the Controller
        can communicate the &ldquo;even&rdquo; profile to all nodes. Only if
        all the nodes have received the POT-Profile, the Controller will tell
        the ingress node to switch to the &ldquo;even&rdquo; profile. Given
        that the indicator travels within the packet, all nodes will switch to
        the &ldquo;even&rdquo; profile. The &ldquo;even&rdquo; profile gets
        active on all nodes and nodes are ready to receive a new
        &ldquo;odd&rdquo; profile.</t>

        <t>Unless the ingress node receives a request to switch profiles,
        it&rsquo;ll continue to use the active profile. If a profile is
        &ldquo;used up&rdquo; the ingress node will recycle the active profile
        and start over (this could give rise to replay attacks in theory
        &ndash; but with 2^32 or 2^64 packets this isn&rsquo;t really likely
        in reality).</t>

              <t>pot-profile-index: <xref target="Procedure"></xref> details
              that two POT-Profiles are used. Only one of the POT-Profiles is
              active at a given point in time, allowing the Controller to
              refresh the non-active one for future use. pot-profile-index
              defines which of the POT-Profiles (the "even" or "odd"
              POT-Profile) is currently active. pot-profile-index will be set
              in the first hop of the path or chain. Other nodes will not use
              this field.</t>

              <t>prime-number: Prime number used for module math
              computation.</t>

              <t>secret-share: Share of the secret of polynomial-1 used in
              computation for the node. If POLY-1 is defined by points (x1_i,
              y1_i) with i=0,..k, then for node i, the secret-share will be
              y1_i.</t>

              node i, the secret-share will be y2_i.</t>

              <t>lpc: Lagrange Polynomial Coefficient for the node, i.e. for
              node i, this would be LPC(l_i), with l_i being the i-th Lagrange
              Basis Polynomial.</t>

              <t>validator?: True if the node is a verifier node.</t>

              <t>validator-key?: The validator-key represents the SECRET as
              described in the sections above. The SECRET is the constant
              coefficient of POLY-1(z). If POLY-1(z) = a_0 + a_1*z +
              a_2*z^2+..+a_k*z^k, then the SECRET would be a_0.</t>

              <t>bitmask?: Number of bits as mask used in controlling the size
              of the random value generation. 32-bits of mask is default. See

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>POT is a mechanism that is used for verifying the path through which
      a packet was forwarded. The security considerations of IOAM in general
      are discussed in <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data"></xref>.
      Specifically, it is assumed that POT is used in a confined network
      domain, and therefore the potential threats that POT is intended to
      mitigate should be viewed accordingly. POT prevents spoofing and
      tampering; an attacker cannot maliciously create a bogus POT or modify a
      legitimate one. Furthermore, a legitimate node that takes part in the
      POT protocol cannot masquerade as another node along the path. These
      considerations are discussed in detail in the rest of this section.</t>

      <section title="Proof of Transit">
        <t>Proof of correctness and security of the solution approach is per
        Shamir&rsquo;s Secret Sharing Scheme <xref target="SSS"></xref>.
        Cryptographically speaking it achieves information-theoretic security
        i.e., it cannot be broken by an attacker even with unlimited computing
        power. As long as the below conditions are met it is impossible for an
        attacker to bypass one or multiple nodes without getting caught.</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>If there are k+1 nodes in the path, the polynomials (POLY-1,
            POLY-2) should be of degree k. Also k+1 points of POLY-1 are
            chosen and assigned to each node respectively. The verifier can
            re-construct the k degree polynomial (POLY-3) only when all the
            points are correctly retrieved.</t>

            <t>Precisely three values are kept secret by individual nodes.
            Share of SECRET (i.e. points on POLY-1), Share of POLY-2, LPC, P.
            Note that only constant coefficient, RND, of POLY-2 is public. x
            values and non-constant coefficient of POLY-2 are secret</t>
          </list> An attacker bypassing a few nodes will miss adding a
        respective point on POLY-1 to corresponding point on POLY-2 , thus the
        verifier cannot construct POLY-3 for cross verification.</t>

        <t>Also it is highly recommended that different polynomials should be
        used as POLY-1 across different paths, traffic profiles or service
        chains.</t>

        <t>If symmetric masking is used to assure OPOT (<xref
        target="mask-opot"></xref>), the nodes need to keep two additional
        secrets: the downstream and upstream masks, that have to be managed
        under the same conditions as the secrets mentioned above. And it is
        equally recommended to employ a different set of mask pairs across
        different paths, traffic profiles or service chains.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Cryptanalysis">
        <t>A passive attacker could try to harvest the POT data (i.e., CML,
        RND values) in order to determine the configured secrets. Subsequently
        two types of differential analysis for guessing the secrets could be
        done. <list style="symbols">
            <t>Inter-Node: A passive attacker observing CML values across
            nodes (i.e., as the packets entering and leaving), cannot perform
            differential analysis to construct the points on POLY-1. This is
            because at each point there are four unknowns (i.e. Share(POLY-1),
            Share(Poly-2) LPC and prime number P) and three known values (i.e.
            RND, CML-before, CML-after). The application of symmetric masking
            for OPOT makes inter-node analysis less feasible.</t>

            <t>Inter-Packets: A passive attacker could observe CML values
            across packets (i.e., values of PKT-1 and subsequent PKT-2), in
            order to predict the secrets. Differential analysis across packets
            could be mitigated using a good PRNG for generating RND. Note that
            if constant coefficient is a sequence number than CML values
            become quite predictable and the scheme would be broken. If
            symmetric masking is used for OPOT, inter-packet analysis could be
            applied to guess mask values, which requires a proper refresh rate
            for masks, at least as high as the one used for LPCs.</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>

      <section title="Anti-Replay">
        <t>A passive attacker could reuse a set of older RND and the
        intermediate CML values. Thus, an attacker can attack an old
        (replayed) RND and CML with a new packet in order to bypass some of
        the nodes along the path.</t>

        <t>Such attacks could be avoided by carefully choosing POLY-2 as a
        (SEQ_NO + RND). For example, if 64 bits are being used for POLY-2 then
        first 16 bits could be a sequence number SEQ_NO and next 48 bits could
        be a random number.</t>

        <t>Subsequently, the verifier could use the SEQ_NO bits to run classic
        anti-replay techniques like sliding window used in IPSEC. The verifier
        could buffer up to 2^16 packets as a sliding window. Packets arriving
        with a higher SEQ_NO than current buffer could be flagged legitimate.
        Packets arriving with a lower SEQ_NO than current buffer could be
        flagged as suspicious.</t>

        <t>For all practical purposes in the rest of the document RND means
        SEQ_NO + RND to keep it simple.</t>

        <t>The solution discussed in this memo does not currently mitigate
        replay attacks. An anti-replay mechanism may be included in future
        versions of the solution.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Anti-Preplay">
        <t>An active attacker could try to perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM)
        attack by extracting the POT of PKT-1 and using it in PKT-2.
        Subsequently attacker drops the PKT-1 in order to avoid duplicate POT
        values reaching the verifier. If the PKT-1 reaches the verifier, then
        this attack is same as Replay attacks discussed before.</t>

        <t>Preplay attacks are possible since the POT metadata is not
        dependent on the packet fields. Below steps are recommended for
        remediation:<list style="symbols">
            <t>Ingress node and Verifier are configured with common pre shared
            key</t>

            <t>Ingress node generates a Message Authentication Code (MAC) from
            packet fields using standard HMAC algorithm.</t>

            <t>The left most bits of the output are truncated to desired
            length to generate RND. It is recommended to use a minimum of 32
            bits.</t>

            <t>The verifier regenerates the HMAC from the packet fields and
            compares with RND. To ensure the POT data is in fact that of the
            packet.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>If an HMAC is used, an active attacker lacks the knowledge of the
        pre-shared key, and thus cannot launch preplay attacks.</t>

        <t>The solution discussed in this memo does not currently mitigate
        preplay attacks. A mitigation mechanism may be included in future
        versions of the solution.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Tampering">
        <t>An active attacker could not insert any arbitrary value for CML.
        This would subsequently fail the reconstruction of the POLY-3. Also an
        attacker could not update the CML with a previously observed value.
        This could subsequently be detected by using timestamps within the RND
        value as discussed above.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Recycling">
        <t>The solution approach is flexible for recycling long term secrets
        like POLY-1. All the nodes could be periodically updated with shares
        of new SECRET as best practice. The table above could be consulted for
        refresh cycles (see <xref target="metadata-for-pot"></xref>).</t>

        <t>If symmetric masking is used for OPOT (<xref
        target="mask-opot"></xref>), mask values must be periodically updated
        as well, at least as frequently as the other secrets are.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Redundant Nodes and Failover">
        <t>A "node" or "service" in terms of POT can be implemented by one or
        multiple physical entities. In case of multiple physical entities
        (e.g., for load-balancing, or business continuity situations -
        consider for example a set of firewalls), all physical entities which
        are implementing the same POT node are given that same share of the
        secret. This makes multiple physical entities represent the same POT
        node from an algorithm perspective.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Controller Operation">
        <t>The Controller needs to be secured given that it creates and holds
        the secrets, as need to be the nodes. The communication between
        Controller and the nodes also needs to be secured. As secure
        communication protocol such as for example NETCONF over SSH should be
        chosen for Controller to node communication.</t>

        <t>The Controller only interacts with the nodes during the initial
        configuration and thereafter at regular intervals at which the
        operator chooses to switch to a new set of secrets. In case 64 bits
        are used for the data fields "CML" and "RND" which are carried within
        the data packet, the regular intervals are expected to be quite long
        (e.g., at 100 Gbps, a profile would only be used up after 3100 years)
        - see <xref target="metadata-for-pot"></xref> above, thus even a
        "headless" operation without a Controller can be considered feasible.
        In such a case, the Controller would only be used for the initial
        configuration of the POT-Profiles.</t>

        <t>If OPOT (<xref target="mask-opot"></xref>) is applied using
        symmetric masking, the Controller will be required to perform a a
        periodic refresh of the mask pairs. The use of OPOT SHOULD be
        configurable as part of the required level of assurance through the
        Controller management interface.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Verification Scope">
        <t>The POT solution defined in this document verifies that a
        data-packet traversed or transited a specific set of nodes. From an
        algorithm perspective, a "node" is an abstract entity. It could be
        represented by one or multiple physical or virtual network devices, or
        is could be a component within a networking device or system. The
        latter would be the case if a forwarding path within a device would
        need to be securely verified.</t>

        <section title="Node Ordering">
          <t>POT using Shamir's secret sharing scheme as discussed in this
          document provides for a means to verify that a set of nodes has been
          visited by a data packet. It does not verify the order in which the
          data packet visited the nodes.</t>

          <t>In case the order in which a data packet traversed a particular
          set of nodes needs to be verified as well, the alternate schemes
          related to OPOT (<xref target="mask-opot"></xref>) have to be
          considered. Since these schemes introduce at least additional
          control requirements, the selection of order verification SHOULD be
          configurable the Controller management interface.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Stealth Nodes">
          <t>The POT approach discussed in this document is to prove that a
          data packet traversed a specific set of "nodes". This set could be
          all nodes within a path, but could also be a subset of nodes in a
          path. Consequently, the POT approach isn't suited to detect whether
          "stealth" nodes which do not participate in proof-of-transit have
          been inserted into a path.</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="POT Yang module">
        <t>The YANG module specified in <xref target="YANG"></xref> of this
        document defines a schema for data that is designed to be accessed via
        network management protocols such as NETCONF <xref
        target="RFC6241"></xref> or RESTCONF <xref target="RFC8040"></xref>.
        The lowest NETCONF <xref target="RFC6241"></xref> layer is the secure
        transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is
        Secure Shell (SSH) <xref target="RFC6242"></xref>. The lowest RESTCONF
        layer is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to- implement secure transport is
        TLS <xref target="RFC5246"></xref>.</t>

        <t>The NETCONF Access Control Module (NACM) <xref
        target="RFC8341"></xref> provides the means to restrict access for
        particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all
        available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol operations and content. There
        are a number of nodes defined in this YANG module which are
        read/writeable. These data nodes may be considered sensitive and
        vulnerable to attacks in some network environments. Ability to read
        from or write into these nodes without proper protection can have a
        negative effect on the devices that support this feature.</t>

    <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
     1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
