      <t>In-situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM) is used
      for recording and collecting operational and telemetry information. 
	  Specifically, IOAM allows telemetry data to be pushed into data packets
	  while they traverse the network. This document introduces a new IOAM 
	  option type called the Direct Export (DEX) option, which is used as 
	  a trigger for IOAM data to be directly exported without being pushed 
	  into in-flight data packets.</t>

      <t>IOAM <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data"/> is used for

	  <t>IOAM makes use of four possible IOAM options, defined in

	  Pre-allocated Trace Option, Incremental Trace 
	  Option, Proof of Transit (POT) Option, and Edge-to-Edge Option.</t>
	  
	  <t>This document defines a new IOAM option type (also known as an IOAM 
	  type) called the Direct Export (DEX) option. This option is used as a 
	  trigger for IOAM nodes to export IOAM data to a receiving entity (or 
	  entities). A "receiving entity" in this context can be, for example, an 
	  external collector, analyzer, controller, decapsulating node, or a 
	  software module in one of the IOAM nodes.</t>

	  <t>This draft has evolved from combining some of the concepts of 
	  PBT-I from <xref target="I-D.song-ippm-postcard-based-telemetry"/> with 
	  immediate exporting from <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-flags"/>.

		  <t>The DEX option is used as a trigger to export IOAM data. The 
		  trigger applies to transit nodes, the decapsulating node, and the 
		  encapsulating node:</t>
		  
          <t><list style="symbols">
                      <t>An IOAM encapsulating node configured to incorporate 
					  the DEX option encapsulates the packet with the DEX 
					  option, and MAY export the requested IOAM data
                      immediately. The IOAM encapsulating node is the only
                      type of node allowed to push the DEX option.</t>

                      <t>A transit node that processes a packet with the DEX

                      with the DEX option MAY export the requested
                      IOAM data, and MUST decapsulate the IOAM header.</t>
          </list></t>

		  <t>As in <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data"/>, the DEX option 
		  may be incorporated into all or a subset of the traffic that is 
		  forwarded by the encapsulating node. Moreover, IOAM nodes MAY
		  export data for all traversing packets that carry the DEX 
		  option, or MAY selectively export data only for a subset of these 
		  packets.</t>
		  
		  <t>The DEX option specifies which data fields should be exported, 
		  as specified in <xref target="OptionSec"/>.
		  The format and encapsulation of the packet that contains the exported 
		  data is not within the scope of the current document. For example, 
		  the export format can be based on 
		  <xref target="I-D.spiegel-ippm-ioam-rawexport"/>.</t>
		  
		  <t>A transit IOAM node that does not support the DEX option SHOULD 
		  ignore it. A decapsulating node that does not support the DEX option
		  MUST remove it, along with any other IOAM options carried in the 
		  packet if such exist.</t>

	      <t>The format of the DEX option is depicted in

		  It is assumed that the lower layer protocol indicates 
		  the length of the DEX option, thus indicating whether the two

        <t>IANA is requested to define an "IOAM DEX Flags" registry. This

    <section anchor="Performance" title="Performance Considerations">
      <t>The DEX option triggers exported packets to be exported to a 
	  receiving entity (or entities). In some cases this may impact the 
	  receiving entity's performance,  or the performance along the paths 
	  leading to it.</t>
	  
	  <t>Therefore, rate limiting may be enabled so as to ensure that 
	  direct exporting is used at a rate that does not significantly affect 
	  the network bandwidth, and does not overload the receiving entity (or the 
	  source node in the case of loopback). It should be possible to use 
	  each DEX on a subset of the data traffic, and to load balance the 
	  exported data among multiple receiving entities.</t>
    </section>

	
    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The security considerations of IOAM in general are discussed in 
	  <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data"/>. Specifically, an attacker
	  may try to use the functionality that is defined in this document 
	  to attack the network.</t>
	  
	  <t>An attacker may attempt to overload network devices by injecting 
	  synthetic packets that include the DEX option. Similarly, an on-path 
	  attacker may maliciously incorporate the DEX option into transit 
	  packets, or maliciously remove it from packets in which it is 
	  incorporated.</t>
	  
	  <t>Forcing DEX, either in synthetic packets or in transit packets may 
	  overload the receiving entity (or entities). Since this mechanism affects 
	  multiple devices along the network path, it potentially amplifies the 
	  effect on the network bandwidth and on the receiving entity's load.</t>

      <t>The amplification effect of DEX may be worse in wide area networks in
      which there are multiple IOAM domains. For example, if DEX is used in
      IOAM domain 1 for exporting IOAM data to a receiving entity, then the
      exported packets of domain 1 can be forwarded through IOAM domain 2,
      in which they are subject to DEX. The exported packets of domain 2 may
      in turn be forwarded through another IOAM domain (or through domain
      1), and theoretically this recursive amplification may continue
      infinitely.</t>	  
	  
	  <t>In order to mitigate the attacks described above, it should be 
	  possible for IOAM-enabled devices to limit the exported IOAM data
	  to a configurable rate.</t>
	  
	  <t>IOAM is assumed to be deployed in a restricted administrative domain,
	  thus limiting the scope of the threats above and their affect. This is
	  a fundamental assumption with respect to the security aspects of IOAM, as
	  further discussed in <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data"/>.</t>

		  <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data"/> has the Hop_Lim/Node_ID bit 
		  set, then exported packets include the Hop_Lim/Node_ID data field, 
		  which contains the TTL/Hop Limit value from a lower layer protocol.
		  </t>
		  
		  <t>An alternative approach was considered during the design of this 
		  document, according to which a 1-octet Hop Count field would be 
		  included in the DEX header (presumably by claiming some space 
		  from the Flags field). The Hop Limit would starts from 0 at the 
		  encapsulating node and be incremented by each IOAM transit node 
		  that supports the DEX option. In this approach the Hop Count field 
		  value would also be included in the exported packet.</t> 
		  
		  <t>The main advantage of the Hop_Lim/Node_ID approach is that it 
		  provides information about the current hop count without requiring 
		  each transit node to modify the DEX option, thus simplifying the data 
		  plane functionality of Direct Exporting.
		  The main advantage of the Hop Count approach that was considered is 
		  that it counts the number of IOAM-capable nodes without relying on 
		  the lower layer TTL, especially when the lower layer cannot prvide 
		  the accurate TTL information, e.g., Layer 2 Ethernet or hierarchical 
		  VPN. The Hop Count approach would also explicitly allow to detect a 
		  case where an IOAM-capable node fails to export packets. It would 
		  also be possible to use a flag to indicate an optional Hop Count 
		  field, which enables to control the tradeoff. On one hand it would 
		  address the use cases that the Hop_Lim/Node_ID cannot cover, and 
		  on the other hand it would not require transit switches to update 
		  the option if it was not supported or disabled. For the sake of 
		  simplicity the Hop Count approach was not pursued, and this field
		  is not incorporated in the DEX header.</t>
