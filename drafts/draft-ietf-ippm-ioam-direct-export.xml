    <abstract>
      <t>In-situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM) is used
      for recording and collecting operational and telemetry information.
      Specifically, IOAM allows telemetry data to be pushed into data packets
      while they traverse the network. This document introduces a new IOAM
      option type called the Direct Export (DEX) option, which is used as a
      trigger for IOAM data to be directly exported or locally aggregated
      without being pushed into in-flight data packets. The exporting method
      and format are outside the scope of this document.</t>

      <t>IOAM <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data"/> is used for monitoring
      traffic in the network, and for incorporating IOAM data fields into
      in-flight data packets.</t>

      <t>IOAM makes use of four possible IOAM options, defined in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data"/>: Pre-allocated Trace Option,
      Incremental Trace Option, Proof of Transit (POT) Option, and
      Edge-to-Edge Option.</t>

      <t>This document defines a new IOAM option type (also known as an IOAM
      type) called the Direct Export (DEX) option. This option is used as a
      trigger for IOAM nodes to locally aggregate and process IOAM data,
      and/or to export it to a receiving entity (or entities). A "receiving
      entity" in this context can be, for example, an external collector,
      analyzer, controller, decapsulating node, or a software module in one of
      the IOAM nodes.</t>

      <t>Note that even though the IOAM Option-Type is called "Direct Export",
      it depends on the deployment whether the receipt of a packet with DEX
      option type leads to the creation of another packet. Some deployments
      might simply use the packet with the DEX option type to trigger local
      processing of OAM data.</t>

      <t>This draft has evolved from combining some of the concepts of PBT-I
      from <xref target="I-D.song-ippm-postcard-based-telemetry"/> with
      immediate exporting from <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-flags"/>.</t>

      <section title="Overview">
        <t>The DEX option is used as a trigger for collecting IOAM data
        locally or for exporting it to a receiving entity (or entities).
        Specifically, the DEX option can be used as a trigger for collecting
        IOAM data by an IOAM node and locally aggregating it; thus, this
        aggregated data can be periodically pushed to a receiving entity, or
        pulled by a receiving entity on-demand.</t>

        <t>This option is incorporated into data packets by an IOAM
        encapsulating node, and removed by an IOAM decapsulating node, as
        illustrated in <xref target="DEXArch"/>. The option can be read but
        not modified by transit nodes. Note: the terms IOAM encapsulating,
        decapsulating and transit nodes are as defined in <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data"/>.</t>

        <t>The DEX option is used as a trigger to collect and/or export IOAM
        data. The trigger applies to transit nodes, the decapsulating node,
        and the encapsulating node:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>An IOAM encapsulating node configured to incorporate the DEX
            option encapsulates (possibly a subset of) the packets it forwards
            with the DEX option, and MAY export and/or collect the requested
            IOAM data immediately. Only IOAM encapsulating nodes are allowed
            to add the DEX option type to a packet.</t>

            <t>A transit node that processes a packet with the DEX option MAY
            export and/or collect the requested IOAM data.</t>

            <t>An IOAM decapsulating node that processes a packet with the DEX
            option MAY export and/or collect the requested IOAM data, and MUST
            decapsulate the IOAM header.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>As in <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data"/>, the DEX option can
        be incorporated into all or a subset of the traffic that is forwarded
        by the encapsulating node, as further discussed in <xref
        target="SelectionSec"/> below. Moreover, IOAM nodes respond to the DEX
        trigger by exporting and/or collection IOAM data either for all
        traversing packets that carry the DEX option, or selectively only for
        a subset of these packets, as further discussed in <xref
        target="ExportSec"/> below.</t>

        <section anchor="SelectionSec" title="DEX Packet Selection">
          <t>If an IOAM encapsulating node incorporates the DEX option into
          all the traffic it forwards it may lead to an excessive amount of
          exported data, which may overload the network and the receiving
          entity. Therefore, an IOAM encapsulating node that supports the DEX
          option MUST support the ability to incorporate the DEX option
          selectively into a subset of the packets that are forwarded by
          it.</t>

          <t>Various methods of packet selection and sampling have been
          previously defined, such as <xref target="RFC7014"/> and <xref
          target="RFC5475"/>. Similar techniques can be applied by an IOAM
          encapsulating node to apply DEX to a subset of the forwarded
          traffic.</t>

          <t>The subset of traffic that is forwarded or transmitted with a DEX
          option SHOULD not exceed 1/N of the interface capacity on any of the
          IOAM encapsulating node's interfaces. It is noted that this
          requirement applies to the total traffic that incorporates a DEX
          option, including traffic that is forwarded by the IOAM
          encapsulating node and probe packets that are generated by the IOAM
          encapsulating node. In this context N is a parameter that can be
          configurable by network operators. If there is an upper bound, M, on
          the number of IOAM transit nodes in any path in the network, then it
          is recommended to use an N such that N &gt;&gt; M. The rationale is
          that a packet that includes a DEX option may trigger an exported
          packet from each IOAM transit node along the path for a total of M
          exported packets. Thus, if N &gt;&gt; M then the number of exported
          packets is significantly lower than the number of data packets
          forwarded by the IOAM encapsulating node. If there is no prior
          knowledge about the network topology or size, it is recommended to
          use N&gt;100.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="ExportSec" title="Responding to the DEX Trigger">
          <t>The DEX option specifies which data fields should be exported
          and/or collected, as specified in <xref target="OptionSec"/>. As
          mentioned above, the data can be locally collected, and optionally
          can be aggregated and exported to a receiving entity, either
          proactively or on-demand. If IOAM data is exported, the format and
          encapsulation of the packet that contains the exported data is not
          within the scope of the current document. For example, the export
          format can be based on <xref
          target="I-D.spiegel-ippm-ioam-rawexport"/>.</t>

          <t>An IOAM node that performs DEX-triggered exporting MUST support
          the ability to limit the rate of the exported packets. The rate of
          exported packets SHOULD be limited so that the number of exported
          packets is significantly lower than the number of packets that are
          exported by the device. The exported data rate SHOULD not exceed 1/N
          of the interface capacity on any of the IOAM node's interfaces. It
          is recommended to use N&gt;100. Depending on the IOAM node's
          architecture considerations, the export rate may be limited to a
          lower number in order to avoid loading the IOAM node.</t>

          <t>Exported packets SHOULD not be exported over a path or a tunnel
          that is subject to IOAM direct exporting. Furthermore, IOAM
          encapsulating nodes that push a DEX option into traversing packets
          MUST avoid pushing an IOAM header into IOAM exported packets. This
          requirement is intended to prevent nested exporting and/or exporting
          loops.</t>

          <t>A transit IOAM node that does not support the DEX option SHOULD
          ignore it. A decapsulating node that does not support the DEX option
          MUST remove it, along with any other IOAM options carried in the
          packet if such exist.</t>

      <section anchor="OptionSec" title="The DEX Option Format">
        <t>The format of the DEX option is depicted in <xref
        target="OptionFormat"/>. The length of the DEX option is either 8
        octets or 16 octets, as the Flow ID and the Sequence Number fields
        (summing up to 8 octets) are optional. It is assumed that the lower
        layer protocol indicates the length of the DEX option, thus indicating
        whether the two optional fields are present.</t>

        <t>IANA is requested to define an "IOAM DEX Flags" registry. This

        on the "RFC Required" procedure, as defined in <xref

    <section anchor="Performance" title="Performance Considerations">
      <t>The DEX option triggers IOAM data to be collected and/or exported
      packets to be exported to a receiving entity (or entities). In some
      cases this may impact the receiving entity's performance, or the
      performance along the paths leading to it.</t>

      <t>Therefore, the performance impact of these exported packets is
      limited by taking two measures: at the encapsulating nodes, by selective
      DEX encapsulation (<xref target="SelectionSec"/>), and at the transit
      nodes, by limiting exporting rate (<xref target="ExportSec"/>). These
      two measures ensure that direct exporting is used at a rate that does
      not significantly affect the network bandwidth, and does not overload
      the receiving entity. Moreover, it is possible to load balance the
      exported data among multiple receiving entities, although the exporting
      method is not within the scope of this document.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The security considerations of IOAM in general are discussed in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data"/>. Specifically, an attacker may try to
      use the functionality that is defined in this document to attack the
      network.</t>

      <t>An attacker may attempt to overload network devices by injecting
      synthetic packets that include the DEX option. Similarly, an on-path
      attacker may maliciously incorporate the DEX option into transit
      packets, or maliciously remove it from packets in which it is
      incorporated.</t>

      <t>Forcing DEX, either in synthetic packets or in transit packets may
      overload the receiving entity (or entities). Since this mechanism
      affects multiple devices along the network path, it potentially
      amplifies the effect on the network bandwidth and on the receiving
      entity's load.</t>

      <t>The amplification effect of DEX may be worse in wide area networks in
      which there are multiple IOAM domains. For example, if DEX is used in
      IOAM domain 1 for exporting IOAM data to a receiving entity, then the
      exported packets of domain 1 can be forwarded through IOAM domain 2, in
      which they are subject to DEX. The exported packets of domain 2 may in
      turn be forwarded through another IOAM domain (or through domain 1), and
      theoretically this recursive amplification may continue infinitely.</t>

      <t>In order to mitigate the attacks described above, the following
      requirements (<xref target="OptionTypeSec"/>) have been defined:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Selective DEX (<xref target="SelectionSec"/>) is applied by IOAM
          encpsulating nodes in order to limit the potential impact of DEX
          attacks to a small fraction of the traffic.</t>

          <t>Rate limiting of exported traffic (<xref target="ExportSec"/>) is
          applied by IOAM nodes in order to prevent overloading attacks and in
          order to significantly limit the scale of amplification attacks.</t>

          <t>IOAM encapsulating nodes are required to avoid pushing the DEX
          option into IOAM exported packets (<xref target="ExportSec"/>), thus
          preventing some of the amplification and export loop scenarios.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Although the exporting method is not within the scope of this
      document, any exporting method MUST secure the exported data from the
      IOAM node to the receiving entity. Specifically, an IOAM node that
      performs DEX exporting MUST send the exported data to a pre-configured
      trusted receiving entity.</t>

      <t>IOAM is assumed to be deployed in a restricted administrative domain,
      thus limiting the scope of the threats above and their affect. This is a
      fundamental assumption with respect to the security aspects of IOAM, as
      further discussed in <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data"/>.</t>

             title="Hop Limit and Hop Count in Direct Exporting">
      <t>In order to help correlate and order the exported packets, it is
      possible to include the Hop_Lim/Node_ID data field in exported packets;
      if the IOAM-Trace-Type <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data"/> has the
      Hop_Lim/Node_ID bit set, then exported packets include the
      Hop_Lim/Node_ID data field, which contains the TTL/Hop Limit value from
      a lower layer protocol.</t>

      <t>An alternative approach was considered during the design of this
      document, according to which a 1-octet Hop Count field would be included
      in the DEX header (presumably by claiming some space from the Flags
      field). The Hop Limit would starts from 0 at the encapsulating node and
      be incremented by each IOAM transit node that supports the DEX option.
      In this approach the Hop Count field value would also be included in the
      exported packet.</t>

      <t>The main advantage of the Hop_Lim/Node_ID approach is that it
      provides information about the current hop count without requiring each
      transit node to modify the DEX option, thus simplifying the data plane
      functionality of Direct Exporting. The main advantage of the Hop Count
      approach that was considered is that it counts the number of
      IOAM-capable nodes without relying on the lower layer TTL, especially
      when the lower layer cannot prvide the accurate TTL information, e.g.,
      Layer 2 Ethernet or hierarchical VPN. The Hop Count approach would also
      explicitly allow to detect a case where an IOAM-capable node fails to
      export packets. It would also be possible to use a flag to indicate an
      optional Hop Count field, which enables to control the tradeoff. On one
      hand it would address the use cases that the Hop_Lim/Node_ID cannot
      cover, and on the other hand it would not require transit switches to
      update the option if it was not supported or disabled. For the sake of
      simplicity the Hop Count approach was not pursued, and this field is not
      incorporated in the DEX header.</t>
